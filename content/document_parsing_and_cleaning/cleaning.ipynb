The synthetic key step is a Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction of an a-amino- synthesis provide control of the oligomer size, but the facile preparative procedure also enables easy access to this type of dyes. Furthermore, functionalized examples were accessible via Various BODIPY oligomer pocbolag BODIPY and the brominated derivatives. Introduction halide. respective Not only does the selective - -  - EN cooe The family of BODIPY dyes, first reported in 1968 by Treibs and Kreuzer,\"l has gained major interest in research in the past decades because of their fairly simple preparative access, their flexibility in terms of possible modifications and their useful properties such as outstanding attenuation coefficients and also high fluorescence quantum yields.2) Hence, they are already widely applied for imaging, e.g. as biomarkers for medical purposes, and have also proven to be applicable in other fields, for instance as various types of photosensitizers and organic light- emitting diodes (OLEDs).3) Various types of oligo-BODIPYS have already shown the capability to enhance such desirable properties and thus have been the focus of much recent preparative chemistry. Alkylene bridged or directly connected BThiswork symmetric & unsymmetric dimers and functionalized examples BODIPYS have been known for several years (Figure 1A (top).141 Figure 1.

      "These types of connectivity have also been converted to extended ANomenclature m-systems by oxidative follow-up reactions, allowing a higher level of conjugation and hence strong bathochromic shifts.5) The installation of heteroatoms has however been a challenge for some time.

Utilizing both symmetric and unsymmetric BODIPY monomers as building blocks has paved the way to selectively synthesize oligomers with various chain lengths. Both symmetric and unsymmetric dimers were synthesized starting from unsymmetric mondfunctionalized monomer units. Additionally, the chain length of these oligo- BODIPYS was extended using the functionalized monomer Br-Ar- R3 R2 31 F a-b-c-d b(monomers & dimers): d (monomers only): Substituent x R Br, R2 R3= H meso-substitution (R\") T c: Grade of oligomerization mono: Monomer di; Dimer 1)n-BuLi, 2,6-dimethyl- aniline, benzaldehyde 4-iso-butyl Et0,rt,5h HN. 2)imidazole, TBSCI CH2Clz. r, 1h TFA, 4-iso-butyl- benzaldehyde CH2Cl.rt,24h H IN 7: 68% 1)NBS, THF, -78 \"C, 1h 2)DDQ, .-78 C thenr rt, 1h 3)PfNEt, BFxOEL2 CH2Cl. rt, 30min o NCS o HN.

In contrast to the aforementioned cyclic amine-linked examples, [8] we have focused on selectively synthesizing open-chained oligomers and addressing their specific properties. Variation of the BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact on the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize Br-Ar-mono-Br selectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monofunctionalized a-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in obtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYS (in contrast to the usual mirror plane through the meso position and boron center) was a Bischler-Napieralski type reaction of the respective chlorinated acylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure developed by Dehaen and coworkers.9 Converting the a-chloro- C)Oligomerization BODIPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald- Hartwig coupling of both led to N-bridged BODIPY dimers, in which alkylpyrroles such as 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (5) and cryptopyrrole (6) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core. Terminal a-brominated examples provide an option for further versatile functionalization. During the investigation of meso substitution patterns, the 4-iso-buty/phenyl moiety has been shown to overcome solubility issues, while maintaining crystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems), whereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level of alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif. For a simplified overview of the BODIPY scope, compounds are labeled according to the systematic nomenclature shown in Scheme 1A. The synthetic strategy began with pyrrole (1) for both kinds of monomers. To obtain monochlorinated BODIPYs, it was first converted into the respective 2-benzoylpyrrole 2 for the meso aryl examples.10 TBS protection of the benzyl alcohol by- product in the crude simplified the purification later on.1) This species and 2-acetylpyrrole were then chlorinated using NCS in THF at room temperature to obtain a-chlorinated 2- -acylpyrroles 3 and 4.!12] NH3(7 N in!

Moreover, products. To arrive finally at the monofunctionalized BODIPY one molecule of CH2Cl2 is adjacent to the cavity, indicating monomers, acylpyrroles 3 and 4 were then converted with the hydrogen bonding to the BF2 units. Furthermore, the C-N-C bond respective alkylpyrroles 5 and 6 in the presence of POCI3 in angles of the N-bridges range between 123° and 127°, showing CHaCln-hexane (2:1), followed by the established procedure for deviation from the theoretical value of 120° for sp?-hybridized BODIPY syntheses from the in situ formed dipyrrin using nitrogen. Within the resulting cavity, the minimum distance triethylamine and BF3*OEt2, with yields up to 91% over 2 steps. between fluorine and the bridging nitrogen atom amounts to 2.9 A To obtain higher oligomers, bisfunctionalized monomers had to and 3.4 A for the opposing BF2 units for the dimer.

The actual BODIPY synthesis was subsequently conducted in a similar manner as for the unsymmetric monomers. However, Pr2NEt was found to give higher yields for less substituted dipyrrins. Thus, using this tertiary C) amine base, in lieu of triethylamine, together with BF3-OEtz gave Br-Ar-mono-Br in 38% yield over three steps. Bromination was necessary in this case because the corresponding chlorinated derivative of an a-amino-BODIPY showed no oligomerization beyond the dimer under the same conditions. Additionally, purification was not an obstacle, in contrast to the aforementioned brominated acylpyrroles. Preparative details of the chlorinated amino-BODIPY are given in the Supporting Information. The respective d-amino-BODIPYS were then synthesized by stirring halogenated BODIPYS in an ammonia solution in MeOH (7 N) in a sealed tube at 60 oC to furnish the target compounds in up to 58% yieldf for chlorinated derivatives and even in quantitative yield for the brominated example (Scheme 1B). For Buchwald- Hartwig coupling of a-chloro- and a-amino-BODIPYS, one equivalent of D) each was converted with Pd(OAc)2, (+)-BINAP and Cs2CO3 in PhMe at 80 C.1141 Interestingly, the reaction times and yields showed a trend of improvement with increasing level of substitution of the BODIPY core with up to 68% yields. While these dimer syntheses were straightforward by simply stirring all of the components together, synthesis of Br-Ar-di required slow addition of Br-Ar-mono-NH2 to a heated solution of the remaining starting material was recovered.

This trend is accentuated for the tetramers, where the absorption signature becomes intricate. However, the intensified coiling in this case, where the terminal BODIPY units start overlapping and thus forming a looped superstructure, results in an exceptionally weak Si+-So excitation at 820 nm. The remaining states of the exciton manifold are hardly assignable because of the amount and overlap of absorption bands, yet they mono-NH2 are responsible for the absorptions at 633 nm and 521 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry (IUPAC convention) was measured of 4 mM solutions in CH2Cl2 with TBAPF6 (0.4 M) in reference to a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) with a scan rate of 200 mV/s (clockwise, starting from 0 V) in steps of 1 mV at room temperature. Conclusion Ins summary, we have successfully developed a method to access linearly amine-linked BODIPYS using Buchwald-Hartwig conditions. Terminal Br substituents allowed elongation of the chain by two further BODIPY subunits. X-ray structure analyses revealed conjugation of the various subunits via the linking nitrogen atom. Absorption spectra show significantly increased attenuation coefficients for the oligomers in comparison to the respective monomers, and also strong bathochromic shifts. DFT calculations provided an insight into the electronic properties and showed a decreasing HOMO/LUMO gap as well as increasing oscillator strengths (fvalues) of the excited states with increasing level of oligomerization. The computed orbital energies are also closely consistent with cyclovoltammetric investigations, demonstrating a more facile oxidation and reduction with 22, 7694-7698. increasing chain length.

Variation of\\nthe BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact\\non the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize Br-Ar-mono-Br\\nselectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monofunctionalized\\na-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in\\nobtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYS (in contrast to the usual\\nmirror plane through the meso position and boron center) was a\\nBischler-Napieralski type reaction of the respective chlorinated\\nacylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure\\ndeveloped by Dehaen and coworkers.9 Converting the a-chloro- C)Oligomerization\\nBODIPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald-\\nHartwig coupling of both led to N-bridged BODIPY dimers, in\\nwhich alkylpyrroles such as 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (5) and\\ncryptopyrrole (6) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core.\\nTerminal a-brominated examples provide an option for further\\nversatile functionalization. During the investigation of meso\\nsubstitution patterns, the 4-iso-buty/phenyl moiety has been\\nshown to overcome solubility issues, while maintaining\\ncrystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems),\\nwhereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level\\nof alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif. For a simplified overview\\nof the BODIPY scope, compounds are labeled according to the\\nsystematic nomenclature shown in Scheme 1A.\\nThe synthetic strategy began with pyrrole (1) for both kinds\\nof monomers.

Bromination was\\nnecessary in this case because the corresponding chlorinated\\nderivative of an a-amino-BODIPY showed no oligomerization\\nbeyond the dimer under the same conditions. Additionally,\\npurification was not an obstacle, in contrast to the aforementioned\\nbrominated acylpyrroles. Preparative details of the chlorinated\\namino-BODIPY are given in the Supporting Information. The\\nrespective d-amino-BODIPYS were then synthesized by stirring\\nhalogenated BODIPYS in an ammonia solution in MeOH (7 N) in\\na sealed tube at 60 oC to furnish the target compounds in up to\\n58% yieldf for chlorinated derivatives and even in quantitative yield\\nfor the brominated example (Scheme 1B).

Utilizing both symmetric and unsymmetric BODIPY monomers as building blocks has paved the way to selectively synthesize oligomers with various chain lengths. Both symmetric and unsymmetric dimers were synthesized starting from unsymmetric monofunctionalized monomer units. Additionally, the chain length of these oligo-BODIPYs was extended using the functionalized monomer Br-Ar-mono-Br and the dimer Br-Ar-di (Scheme 1).\n",

      "\n",
      "In contrast to the aforementioned cyclic amine-linked examples, we have focused on selectively synthesizing open-chained oligomers and addressing their specific properties. Variation of the BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact on the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize Br-Ar-mono-Br selectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monofunctionalized α-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in obtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYs (in contrast to the usual mirror plane through the meso position and boron center) was a Bischler-Napieralski type reaction of the respective chlorinated acylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure developed by Dehaen and coworkers. Converting the α-chloro-BODIPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of both led to N-bridged BODIPY dimers, in which alkylpyrroles such as 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (5) and cryptopyrrole (6) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core. Terminal α-brominated examples provide an option for further versatile functionalization. During the investigation of meso substitution patterns, the 4-iso-butylphenyl moiety has been shown to overcome solubility issues while maintaining crystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems), whereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level of alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif. For a simplified overview of the BODIPY scope, compounds are labeled according to the systematic nomenclature shown in Scheme 1A.\n",
      "\n",
      "The synthetic strategy began with pyrrole (1) for both kinds of monomers. To obtain monochlorinated BODIPYs, it was first converted into the respective 2-benzoylpyrrole 2 for the meso aryl examples. TBS protection of the benzyl alcohol by-product in the crude simplified the purification later on. This species and 2-acetylpyrrole were then chlorinated using NCS in THF at room temperature to obtain α-chlorinated 2-acylpyrroles 3 and 4.\n",

      "We preferred chlorination over the analogous bromination since the by-products were easier to separate from the desired products. To arrive finally at the monofunctionalized BODIPY monomers, acylpyrroles 3 and 4 were then converted with the respective alkylpyrroles 5 and 6 in the presence of POCl3 in CH2Cl2-hexane (2:1), followed by the established procedure for BODIPY syntheses from the in situ formed dipyrrin using triethylamine and BF3·OEt2, with yields up to 91% over 2 steps. To obtain higher oligomers, bisfunctionalized monomers had to be synthesized prior to amination. For symmetrically bisfunctionalized monomer Br-Ar-mono-Br, an excess of pyrrole (1) was converted into dipyrromethane 7 using 4-iso-butylbenzaldehyde with catalytic amounts of TFA in CH2Cl2 in 68% yield. Stepwise addition of NBS in small portions to a solution of 7 in THF at -78 °C for selective bromination, followed by oxidation with DDQ, gave the crude dipyrrin, which was used in the following step after filtration. The actual BODIPY synthesis was subsequently conducted in a similar manner as for the unsymmetric monomers. However, iPr2NEt was found to give higher yields for less substituted dipyrrins. Thus, using this tertiary amine base, in lieu of triethylamine, together with BF3·OEt2 gave Br-Ar-mono-Br in 38% yield over three steps. Bromination was necessary in this case because the corresponding chlorinated derivative of an α-amino-BODIPY showed no oligomerization beyond the dimer under the same conditions. Additionally, purification was not an obstacle, in contrast to the aforementioned brominated acylpyrroles. Preparative details of the chlorinated amino-BODIPY are given in the Supporting Information. The respective α-amino-BODIPYs were then synthesized by stirring halogenated BODIPYs in an ammonia solution in MeOH (7 N) in a sealed tube at 60 °C to furnish the target compounds in up to 58% yield for chlorinated derivatives and even in quantitative yield for the brominated example (Scheme 1B). For Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of α-chloro- and α-amino-BODIPYs, one equivalent of each was converted with Pd(OAc)2, (+)-BINAP, and Cs2CO3 in PhMe at 80 °C. Interestingly, the reaction times and yields showed a trend of improvement with increasing level of substitution of the BODIPY core with up to 68% yields. While these dimer syntheses were straightforward by simply stirring all of the components together, synthesis of Br-Ar-di required slow addition of Br-Ar-mono-NH2 to a heated solution of the remaining reagents. Such a procedure ensured selectivity by maintaining an excess of Br-Ar-mono-Br to avoid further oligomerization. The reaction of Br-Ar-mono-Br with EDM-Ar-mono-Br yielded 44% of the functionalized dimer, while 45% of the starting material was recovered. As for the dimers synthesized via the chlorides, synthesis of trimers and tetramers was achieved in the same manner with the respective bromides (Br-Ar-di for EDM-tet), with a remarkable decrease in the reaction time. Throughout the reaction of Br-Ar-mono-Br with EDM-Ar-mono-Br, formation of the respective intermediate dimer was observed within 30 minutes, while full conversion took an additional 60 minutes.\n",

      "It was possible to obtain crystals from the dimers and from EDM-tri. For all dimers, the BODIPY cores are mutually slightly twisted (~12°, see Figure 2B). The small twist angle, however, implies a certain amount of conjugation through the central nitrogen atom. In contrast, EDM-tri shows a stronger deviation from planarity, which is probably attributable to steric hindrance, thus causing one of the peripheral cores to be tilted by as much as 29° with regard to the plane of the residual two units. Moreover, one molecule of CH2Cl2 is adjacent to the cavity, indicating hydrogen bonding to the BF2 units. Furthermore, the C-N-C bond angles of the N-bridges range between 123° and 127°, showing deviation from the theoretical value of 120° for sp2-hybridized nitrogen. Within the resulting cavity, the minimum distance between fluorine and the bridging nitrogen atom amounts to 2.9 Å and 3.4 Å for the opposing BF2 units for the dimer. The trimer in comparison shows larger distances of the two closest fluorine atoms of two different BF2 groups (3.9 Å) and as much as 5.2 Å for the two peripheral BODIPY units (Figure 2C).

      "The photophysical behavior of the dimers shows a strong bathochromic shift of the main absorption band compared to the respective monomers (from λmax = 510 nm to 659 nm for the EDM examples) and also significantly increased attenuation coefficients (Figure 3). An excerpt of the respective data is given below (Table 1). The presence of a second absorption region at approximately 500 nm (S2 state) indicates a Davydov splitting as a result of an excitonic coupling process. The unusual double-peak shape may suggest some conformational instabilities. In this context, the absorption profile is expanded to three absorption events at the trimer, corresponding to three excitonic states excited at 752 nm (S1), 562 nm (S2), and 470 nm (S3), respectively. Notably, the S2 state exhibits the highest oscillator strength, attributed to the significant geometrical deviation from linearity, gradually leading to a helical superstructure for higher homologs (Figure 4). This trend is accentuated for the tetramers, where the absorption signature becomes intricate. However, the intensified coiling in this case, where the terminal BODIPY units start overlapping and thus forming a looped superstructure, results in an exceptionally weak S1→S0 excitation at 820 nm. The remaining states of the exciton manifold are hardly assignable because of the amount and overlap of absorption bands, yet they are responsible for the absorptions at 633 nm and 521 nm. The oscillator strength distribution of the exciton manifold was simulated through TDDFT computations and accurately mirrors the experimentally observed absorption band intensities for all oligomer species (Figure 4). The emission strength decreases gradually along the oligomeric series. While the monomers exhibit fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of up to 0.53 in CH2Cl2, these values decrease to ΦF < 0.01 for the dimer and trimer. For the tetramers, emission is hardly detectable (ΦF << 0.01).\n",

      "In summary, we have successfully developed a method to access linearly amino-linked BODIPYs using Buchwald-Harwig conditions. Terminal Br substituents allowed elongation of the chain by two further BODIPY subunits. X-ray structure analyses revealed conjugation of the various subunits via the linking nitrogen atom. Absorption spectra show significantly increased attenuation coefficients for the oligomers in comparison to the respective monomers, and also strong bathochromic shifts. DFT calculations provided an insight into the electronic properties and showed a decreasing HOMO/LUMO gap as well as increasing oscillator strengths (_f_ values) of the excited states with increasing level of oligomerization. The computed orbital energies are also closely consistent with cyclovoltammetric investigations, demonstrating a more facile oxidation and reduction with increasing chain length.\n",

      "[{'Introduction': ['Since Tang and co-workers firstly demonstrated that the use of hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for hole injection from the anodes into the light-emitting layer could provides the significant improvement of the OLED device performance [1], much attention have been devoted to the development of new hole-transporting materials [2] in recent years. Recently, small molecule weight triarylamine derivatives have attracted much interest as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for use in multilayer OLEDs [3–5] due to their high mobility and are easily oxidized to form stable radical cations that act as hole-transporting species. Furthermore, they are easily purified by vapor deposition techniques or column chromatography and uniform thin film can be prepared by simple coating techniques. Examples of triarylamine-based HTM are 4,4′-bis(m-tolylphenylamino) of biphenyl (TPD) [6–8], bistriphenylamine end-capped oligothiophenes [9], spiro-silabifluorene [10,11] and bi-furyl derivatives [12], and dithioenosilole [13] and dicarbazolyl [14] derivatives containing peripheral triarylamines. Moreover, for practical OLED devices, a simple structure hole-transporting material (HTM) with high mobility of hole, stable amorphous state, easy form good thin film by spin-coating techniques, and preferable a simple preparation is necessary. Therefore, there are continually research interest in the design and synthesis of new HTMs materials with excellent properties.', 'As a large conjugated aromatic ring, pyrene not only has the advantages of high PL efficiency [15], high carrier mobility, but also has the much improved hole-injection ability than oligofluorenes or polyfluorene [16]. More recently, some pyrene derivatives have been successfully used in OLEDs to improve hole-transporting ability arising from their electron-rich property [17,18].', 'Thus there is substantial interest in investigating new pyrene derivatives with excellent properties as promising candidates for high-performance OLEDs applications. Recently, pyrene-based materials for organic electronics, which include the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions bromopyrenes were widely developed [19]. In this paper, we wish to report here the synthesis of three types of pyrene derivatives that combined the high hole mobility function of diarylamine as substituents with the high efficiency and hole-injection ability of pyrene as the conjugation core, by using a modified Buchwald–Hartwig amination reaction. Moreover, photophysical properties of these compounds are fully examined in solution through spectroscopy techniques.']}, {'Experimental': [' 1H/13C NMR spectra were recorded at 300MHz and 75MHz on a Nippon Denshi JEOL FT-300 NMR spectrometer in deuteriochloroform with Me4Si as an internal reference.

Bromination of pyrene 1 with 1.1 equivalents of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBMH) [22] in CH2Cl2 at room temperature for 1h afforded a mixture of 1,6-di- and 1,8-dibromopyrene 3 and 4 in yield of 97%. 1,3,6,8-Tetrabromopyrene 5 was readily obtained by the exhaustive bromination of pyrene 1 with 4.5 equivalents of bromine in nitrobenzene at 120°C for 12h as following the previous reported procedures (Scheme 1 ) [24]. Although attempted separation of the mixture of 1,6- and 1,8-dibromopyrene (3 and 4) into each pure failed, the mixture of isomers of 1,6-di- and 1,8-dibromopyrene (3 and 4) was directly used to carry out next Buchwald–Hartwig amination reaction using the –C–N– as linked bridge.', 'The Buchwald–Hartwig amination reactions were carried out between the 1-bromopyrene 2, 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene 5 and the diphenylamines 6 under the modified reaction conditions [25,26] to afford the targets 1-(N,N-diarylamino)- and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis-(N,N-diarylamino)-subsituted pyrenes 7(a/b) and 10(a/b) in good yields, respectively. Similarly, the mixture of 3 and 4 was reacted with the diphenylamines 6a and 6b afforded 8a/9a and 8b/9b in 68% and 73% yields, respectively (Scheme 1). Both the 1-substituted pyrenes (7a/b) and the tetra-subsituted pyrenes (10a/b) were successfully purified by column chromatography and recrystallization. Although several attempted isolations of the mixture of 1,6- and 1,8-bis-substituted pyrenes (8a/8b and 9a/9b) in each pure form failed, the two mixtures of compounds, 8a/9a and 8b/9b were directly used to determine their photophysical properties.', 'The structures of these new diarylamino-functionalized pyrene derivatives 7–10 were fully characterized by 1H/13C NMR, mass spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. In particular, due to their C 2 h point-group symmetric structures, their 1H NMR spectrum of these tetra-substituted pyrene derivatives 10a and 10b are very simple, for example, the compound 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N,N-di-(4-methylphenyl)]pyrene 10b display two singlet at δ =7.93ppm and 7.57ppm for the pyrene ring protons at 4-, 5-, 9-, and 10-positions and 2-, 7-positions, respectively, a pair of doublets in a 1:1 ratio in the region at δ =6.93 and δ =6.85ppm for the aromatic protons, a singlet at δ =2.35ppm for the eight methyl groups protons. Simultaneously, the structures of 7–10 were further established on the basis of the base peak molecular ion at m/z [M+] 369 for 7a, 397 for 7b, 537 for 8a/9a, 593 for 8b/9b, 871 for 10a, and 983 for 10b in their mass spectrum, respectively. All results were well consistent with the proposed structures. On the other hand, these three types of diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes 7–10 are very stable solids with colors of from orange to red that can be stored in air for prolonged period of times at room temperature. All compounds have good solubility in all the common organic solvents including hexane with melting points from 176°C to over 300°C, increasing as the number of the diarylamino-substituents.', 'The molecular structure of compound 10a was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The crystals were grown by slow evaporation of a CHCl3 concentrated solution. This compound was obtained as orange needles and provided excellent quality data. The crystallographic data for this compound 10a are summarized in Table 1 .', 'Structure diagrams of 10a are shown in Fig. 1 i and ii. The molecule lies on a onefold axis; thus all is crystallographically unique. The four diphenylamino groups are completely twisted against the central pyrene ring with certain angles. Generally, the efficient π-stacking in emitting molecules could lead to extensive excimer formation in the solid state or thin film with low quantum yields of fluorescence. The crystal packing diagrams of 10a are also shown in Fig. 1iii. No crystal packings were observed in this crystal due to the big sterically hindrance arising from the bulky diphenylamino groups attached in the pyrene ring at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions. Thus, these newly prepared diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes with less π−π stacking intermolecular interactions suggests that they might be advantageous as promising emitters in optoelectronic device applications.', 'The UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of these three types of diarylamino-substituted pyrenes 7–10 were measured in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and the key photophysical data are listed in Table 2 .', 'The spectroscopic properties of these diarylamino-functionalized pyrene derivatives 7–10 were measured in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solution at 25°C and are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively.', 'As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption spectra of 7–10 showed a π–π * band at ∼379–472nm. Consequently, for the 1-(N,N-diarylamino)-substituted pyrenes, the absorption maxima of 7a (379nm) and 7b (407nm) are red-shifted ca. 40nm and 70nm compared with that of unsubstituted pyrene 1 (336nm), for the isomer of 1,6-bis- and 1,8-bis-(N,N-diphenylamino)-substituted pyrenes (8a/9a) and (8b/9b), the absorption spectra maxima (422nm for 8a/9a and 431nm for 8b/9b) are red-shifted ca. 80 and 90nm relative to that of unsubstituted pyrene 1, respectively, and the 1,3,6,8-tetrakis-(N,N-diphenylamino)-substituted pyrenes 10a and 10b, the π–π * maxima band were observed at 461 and 472nm, respectively, which are gradually red-shifted ca. 120nm and 130nm compared to that of unsubstituted pyrene 1, respectively. Furthermore, there is a slight red-shift in the absorption spectra of 7b relative to that of 7a, which can be ascribed to the electron-donating ability of methyl groups. Similar results can also be observed in the absorption spectra of 8/9 and 10. Thus, these results strongly indicate that not only the number of substituents but also the difference of substituents characteristics can significantly affect the spectroscopic properties of these diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes.', 'The fluorescence-emission spectra of 7–10 are shown in Fig. 3. Dilute solutions of 7–10 in dichloromethane showed sky-blue to green emission as the number of substituent increased. It is interesting that the compounds that have methyl groups (7b, 8b/9b and 10b) showed significantly red-shifted fluorescence relative to those that have no methyl groups (7a, 8a/9a and 10a). On the other hand, the emission maxima of 7a, 8a/9a, and 10a, consecutively shifted to longer wavelengths at 464, 481 and 494nm, in a manner similar to their absorption maxima and the fluorescence spectra of 7b, 8b/9b and 10b, are also varied at 474, 494 and 500nm, respectively, also in agreement with the electronic absorption spectra. These phenomena can also be observed in some carbazole-based dendrimers [27] and several phenylethynyl-substituted pyrene derivatives [28,29]. The fluorescence spectrum of 10b was the most red-shifted among all the compounds examined (Table 2).', 'The fluorescence quantum yields (Φf ) of 7–10 recorded in dichloromethane are also presented in Table 2. The Φf values of 7–10 were found in the range of 0.84–0.96 relative to that of 9,10-diphenylanthracene (0.90 in cyclohexane) [29].', 'To obtain better understanding of the electronic spectroscopic properties of these diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes, the 1-substituted pyrene 7b and the tetrakis-substituted pyrene 10b were selected as the candidates, and the optical absorption and emission spectroscopic data of 7b and 10b recorded in various solvents are summarized in Table 3 .', 'It is well known that the solvatochromitic effect is not only depends on the molecular structure, but also depends on the nature of the chromophore, and the solvents [30]. Each molecule shows a certain solvatochromic behavior (Figs. 4 and 5 ). The emission spectrum exhibits a more significant red shift in polar solvents than in nonpolar solvents (see Table 3). For example, the emission maxima of 7a in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (504nm) is ca. 64nm red-shifted from that in cyclohexane (440nm) (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the emission maxima of 10b gradually increases (ca. 20nm) going from cyclohexane (490nm) to DMF (510nm) (Fig. 5B). This solvatochromism can be attributed to the decease in the energy of the singlet excited states as a function of an increase in the polarity of the solvents.', 'Typically, a fluorophore has a larger dipole moment in the excited state than in the ground state. Following excitation, solvent dipoles can reorient or relax lowing the energy of the excited state [30]. So, these results above observed indicated that the μe (dipole moment of 7b and 10b in the excited state) should be larger than the μg (the dipole moment of 7b and 10b in the ground state) because a positive solvatochromic effect was observed. On the other hand, the solvatochromic effect indicates the compounds possess intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor (diarylamine) to the acceptor (pyrene center) units [31]. Interestingly, although compound 10b has a more number of substituent, it shows less solvatochromic shift compared with that of compound 7b. This may be due to 10b bearing more symmetrical than 7b, which results in lower excited dipole of 10b getting less stabilization by the solvent dipole [32].', 'These results further indicated that the μe (the dipole moments of 7 and 10 in the excited state) should be the little larger than the μg (the dipole moments of 7 and 10 in the ground state) because the positive solvatochromic effects were observed in both the absorption spectra and the emission spectra [33,34]. Although the dipole moments of 10 in either the ground or excited states are indeed zero because they are possessed centre-symmetric in the ideal C 2 h symmetry, these results obtained above demonstrated that the Qe (the quadrupole moments of 10 in the excited state) should be larger than the Qg (the quadrupole moments of 10 in the ground state) because the positive solvatochromic effects were observed in both the absorption spectra and the emission spectra, which implies that there is a change in the quadropole moment upon excitation [35]. On the other hand, the fact that solvatochromic effects are more important for emission than for absorption suggests that these diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes are more solvated in the excited state than in the ground state [36].']}, {'Conclusions': ['A series of diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes 7–10 have been synthesized in high yields by a modified Buchwald–Hartwig amination reaction. Photophysical properties studies of 7–10 indicated that there are significant effects on the UV–vis absorption spectra and the emission spectra as the number of diarylamino-substituent increased. All compounds 7–10 emit very bright fluorescent emissions, from sky-blue to green in solution (Φf =0.84–0.96 in dichloromethane), and have good solubility in common organic solvents and high stability. Slight solvatochromic effects can be observed for the mono-diarylamino-substituted pyrenes 7 and the tetra-diarylamino-substituted pyrenes 10 in solutions, which imply that these current compounds 7 and 10 are more solvated in the excited state than in the ground state. The herein-presented molecules are exciting new materials that combine excellent optical features and an improved thermal stability. Thus, their potential applications in OLEDs can be suggested and further explorations into this area are currently under study in our laboratory.']}]\n"
