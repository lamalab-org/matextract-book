Utilizing both symmetric and unsymmetric BODIPY monomers as building blocks has paved the way to selectively synthesize oligomers with various chain lengths. Both symmetric and unsymmetric dimers were synthesized starting from unsymmetric mondfunctionalized monomer units.

In contrast to the aforementioned cyclic amine-linked examples, [8] we have focused on selectively synthesizing open-chained oligomers and addressing their specific properties. Variation of the BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact on the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize Br-Ar-mono-Br selectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monofunctionalized a-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in obtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYS (in contrast to the usual mirror plane through the meso position and boron center) was a Bischler-Napieralski type reaction of the respective chlorinated acylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure developed by Dehaen and coworkers.9 Converting the a-chloro- C)Oligomerization BODIPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald- Hartwig coupling of both led to N-bridged BODIPY dimers, in which alkylpyrroles such as 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (5) and cryptopyrrole (6) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core. Terminal a-brominated examples provide an option for further versatile functionalization. During the investigation of meso substitution patterns, the 4-iso-buty/phenyl moiety has been shown to overcome solubility issues, while maintaining crystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems), whereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level of alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif. For a simplified overview of the BODIPY scope, compounds are labeled according to the systematic nomenclature shown in Scheme 1A. The synthetic strategy began with pyrrole (1) for both kinds of monomers. To obtain monochlorinated BODIPYs, it was first converted into the respective 2-benzoylpyrrole 2 for the meso aryl examples.10 TBS protection of the benzyl alcohol by- product in the crude simplified the purification later on.1) This species and 2-acetylpyrrole were then chlorinated using NCS in THF at room temperature to obtain a-chlorinated 2- -acylpyrroles 3 and 4.!12] NH3(7 N in!

Moreover, products. To arrive finally at the monofunctionalized BODIPY one molecule of CH2Cl2 is adjacent to the cavity, indicating monomers, acylpyrroles 3 and 4 were then converted with the hydrogen bonding to the BF2 units. Furthermore, the C-N-C bond respective alkylpyrroles 5 and 6 in the presence of POCI3 in angles of the N-bridges range between 123° and 127°, showing CHaCln-hexane (2:1), followed by the established procedure for deviation from the theoretical value of 120° for sp?-hybridized BODIPY syntheses from the in situ formed dipyrrin using nitrogen. Within the resulting cavity, the minimum distance triethylamine and BF3*OEt2, with yields up to 91% over 2 steps. between fluorine and the bridging nitrogen atom amounts to 2.9 A To obtain higher oligomers, bisfunctionalized monomers had to and 3.4 A for the opposing BF2 units for the dimer.

The actual BODIPY synthesis was subsequently conducted in a similar manner as for the unsymmetric monomers. However, Pr2NEt was found to give higher yields for less substituted dipyrrins. Thus, using this tertiary C) amine base, in lieu of triethylamine, together with BF3-OEtz gave Br-Ar-mono-Br in 38% yield over three steps. Bromination was necessary in this case because the corresponding chlorinated derivative of an a-amino-BODIPY showed no oligomerization beyond the dimer under the same conditions. Additionally, purification was not an obstacle, in contrast to the aforementioned brominated acylpyrroles. Preparative details of the chlorinated amino-BODIPY are given in the Supporting Information. The respective d-amino-BODIPYS were then synthesized by stirring halogenated BODIPYS in an ammonia solution in MeOH (7 N) in a sealed tube at 60 oC to furnish the target compounds in up to 58% yieldf for chlorinated derivatives and even in quantitative yield for the brominated example (Scheme 1B). For Buchwald- Hartwig coupling of a-chloro- and a-amino-BODIPYS, one equivalent of D) each was converted with Pd(OAc)2, (+)-BINAP and Cs2CO3 in PhMe at 80 C.1141 Interestingly, the reaction times and yields showed a trend of improvement with increasing level of substitution of the BODIPY core with up to 68% yields. While these dimer syntheses were straightforward by simply stirring all of the components together, synthesis of Br-Ar-di required slow addition of Br-Ar-mono-NH2 to a heated solution of the remaining starting material was recovered.

This trend is accentuated for the tetramers, where the absorption signature becomes intricate. However, the intensified coiling in this case, where the terminal BODIPY units start overlapping and thus forming a looped superstructure, results in an exceptionally weak Si+-So excitation at 820 nm. The remaining states of the exciton manifold are hardly assignable because of the amount and overlap of absorption bands, yet they mono-NH2 are responsible for the absorptions at 633 nm and 521 nm.

Sysak, Figure Cyclic voltammograms. Cyclic voltammetry (IUPAC convention) was measured of 4 mM solutions in CH2Cl2 with TBAPF6 (0.4 M) in reference to a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) with a scan rate of 200 mV/s (clockwise, starting from 0 V) in steps of 1 mV at room temperature. Conclusion Ins summary, we have successfully developed a method to access linearly amine-linked BODIPYS using Buchwald-Hartwig conditions. Terminal Br substituents allowed elongation of the chain by two further BODIPY subunits. X-ray structure analyses revealed conjugation of the various subunits via the linking nitrogen atom. Absorption spectra show significantly increased attenuation coefficients for the oligomers in comparison to the respective monomers, and also strong bathochromic shifts. DFT calculations provided an insight into the electronic properties and showed a decreasing HOMO/LUMO gap as well as increasing oscillator strengths (fvalues) of the excited states with increasing level of oligomerization. The computed orbital energies are also closely consistent with cyclovoltammetric investigations, demonstrating a more facile oxidation and reduction with 22, 7694-7698. increasing chain length.

Hence, they are already widely applied for imaging, e.g., as biomarkers for medical purposes, and have also proven to be applicable in other fields, for instance, as various types of photosensitizers and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Various types of oligo-BODIPYs have already shown the capability to enhance such desirable properties and thus have been the focus of much recent preparative chemistry. Alkylene-bridged or directly connected symmetric and unsymmetric dimers and functionalized examples of BODIPYs have been known for several years (Figure 1A, top).\n",

The installation of heteroatoms has, however, been a challenge for some time. In 2014, Shinokubo et al. presented linearly connected monomers through an azo-bridge at the β-position (Figure 1A, d). Linear connectivity at the α-position using heteroatoms such as sulfur has been achieved through a similarly iterative process by the groups of Hao and Jiao (Figure 1A, e). Furthermore, cyclic amine-linked oligo-BODIPYs have already been synthesized in a one-pot reaction in 2022 by Song et al., utilizing Buchwald-Hartwig conditions (Figure 1A, f).\n",

Variation of the BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact on the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize Br-Ar-mono-Br selectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monofunctionalized α-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in obtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYs (in contrast to the usual mirror plane through the meso position and boron center) was a Bischler-Napieralski type reaction of the respective chlorinated acylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure developed by Dehaen and coworkers. Converting the α-chloro-BODIPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of both led to N-bridged BODIPY dimers, in which alkylpyrroles such as 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (5) and cryptopyrrole (6) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core. Terminal α-brominated examples provide an option for further versatile functionalization. During the investigation of meso substitution patterns, the 4-iso-butylphenyl moiety has been shown to overcome solubility issues while maintaining crystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems), whereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level of alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif.

To obtain higher oligomers, bisfunctionalized monomers had to be synthesized prior to amination. For symmetrically bisfunctionalized monomer Br-Ar-mono-Br, an excess of pyrrole (1) was converted into dipyrromethane 7 using 4-iso-butylbenzaldehyde with catalytic amounts of TFA in CH2Cl2 in 68% yield. Stepwise addition of NBS in small portions to a solution of 7 in THF at -78 °C for selective bromination, followed by oxidation with DDQ, gave the crude dipyrrin, which was used in the following step after filtration.

                        "In contrast to the aforementioned cyclic amine-linked examples,[10] we have focused on selectively synthesizing open-chained oligomers and addressing their specific properties. Variation of the BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact on the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize selectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monontunctionalized \\(\\alpha\\)-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in obtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYs (in contrast to the usual mirror plane through the _mes_ position and boron center) was a Bischler-Napierals type reaction of the respective chlorinated acylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure developed by Dehaen and coworkers.[10] Converting the \\(\\alpha\\)-chloropolipPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of both led to _N_-bridged BODIPY dimers, in which alkyl/pyrroles such as 2,4-dimethyl/pyrrole (**5**) and cryptopyrrole (**6**) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core. Terminal \\(\\alpha\\)-brominated examples provide an option for further versatile functionalization. During the investigation of _mes_ substitution patterns, the _4-iso_-butylphenyl moiety has been shown to overcome solubility issues, while maintaining crystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems), whereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level of alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif. For a simplified overview of the BODIPY scope, compounds are labeled according to the systematic nomenclature shown in Scheme 1A.\n",
                        "\n",
                        "The synthetic strategy began with pyrrole (1) for both kinds of monomers. To obtain monochlorinated BODIPYs, it was first converted into the respective 2-benzoylpyrrole **2** for the _mes_ and examples.[10] TBS protection of the benzyl alcohol by-product in the crude simplified the purification later on.[11] This species and 2-acetylpyrrole were then chlorinated using NCS in THF at room temperature to obtain \\(\\alpha\\)-chlorinated 2-acyl/pyrroles **3** and **4**.[12]We preferred chlorination over the analogous bromination since the by-products were easier to separate from the desired products. To arrive finally at the monfoundenticalized BODIPY monomers, acy/pyrroles **3** and **4** were then converted with the respective alkyl/pyrroles **5** and **6** in the presence of POCl\\({}_{3}\\) in CH\\({}_{4}\\)Cl/n-hexane (2:1), followed by the established procedure for BODIPY syntheses from the _in situ_ formed glytrium using triethylamine and BF\\({}_{x}\\)-OEL\\({}_{x}\\), with yields up to 91% over 2 steps. To obtain higher oligomers, bistunctionalized monomers had to be synthesized prior to amination. For symmetrically bistunctionalized monomer **Br-Ar-mono-Br**, an excess of pyrrole (1) was converted into dipryromethane **7** using 4-iso-butylbenzaldehyde with catalytic amounts of TFA in CH\\({}_{4}\\)Cl\\({}_{2}\\) in 68% yield.[13] Stepwise addition of NBS in small portions to a solution of **7** in THF at -78 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for selective bromination, followed by oxidation with DDQ, gave the crude glytrium, which was used in the following step after filtration. The actual BODIPY synthesis was subsequently conducted in a similar manner as for the unsymmetric monomers. However, \\(\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$ \\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$\\text{$}}}$}$}$}$}}}}}$}}$}\\)Net was found to give higher yields for less substituted glytrirens. Thus, using this tertiary amine base, in lieu of triethylamine, together with BF\\({}_{x}\\)-OEL\\({}_{x}\\) gave **Br-Ar-mono-Br** in 38% yield over three steps. Bromination was necessary in this case because the corresponding chlorinated derivative of an \\(\\alpha\\)-amino-BODIPY showed no oligomerization beyond the dimer under the same conditions. Additionally, purification was not an obstacle, in contrast to the aforementioned brominated acy/pyrroles. Preparative details of the chlorinated amino-BODIPY are given in the Supporting Information. The respective \\(\\alpha\\)-amino-BODIPYs were then synthesized by stirring halogenated BODIPYs in an ammonia solution in MeOH (7 N) in a sealed tube at 60 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C to furnish the target compounds in up to 58% yield for chlorinated derivatives and even in quantitative yield for the brominated example (Scheme 1B). For Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of \\(\\alpha\\)-chloro- and \\(\\alpha\\)-amino-BODIPYs, one equivalent of each was converted with Pd(OAC\\({}_{2}\\)), (\\(\\pm\\))-BINAP and Cs\\({}_{2}\\)CO\\({}_{3}\\) in PhMe at 80 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C.[14] Interestingly, the reaction times and yields showed a trend of improvement with increasing level of substitution of the BODIPY core with up to 68% yields. While these dimer syntheses were straight forward by simply stirring all of the components together, synthesis of **Br-Ar-dil** required slow addition of **Br-Ar-mono-MrIz** to a heated solution of the remaining reagents. Such a procedure ensured selectivity by maintaining an excess of **Br-Ar-mono-Br** to avoid further oligomerization. The reaction yielded 44% of the functionalization dimer, while 45% of the starting material was recovered. As for the dimers synthesized via the chlorides, synthesis of trimers and tetramers was achieved in same manner with the respective bromides (**Br-Ar-dil** for **EDM-tet**), with a remarkable decrease of the reaction time. Throughout the reaction of **Br-Ar-mono-Br** with **EDM-Ar-mono-Br**, formation of the respective intermediate dimer was observed within 30 minutes, while full conversion took an additional 60 minutes.\n",

Absorption spectra show significantly increased attenuation coefficients for the oligomers in comparison to the respective monomers, and also strong bathochromic shifts. DFT calculations provided an insight into the electronic properties and showed a decreasing HOMO/LUMO gap as well as increasing oscillator strengths (_f_ values) of the excited states with increasing level of oligomerization. The computed orbital energies are also closely consistent with cyclovoltammetric investigations, demonstrating a more facile oxidation and reduction with increasing chain length.\n",
