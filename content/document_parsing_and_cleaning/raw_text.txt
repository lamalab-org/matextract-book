The family of BODIPY dyes, first reported in 1968 by Treibs and
Kreuzer,"l has gained major interest in research in the past
decades because of their fairly simple preparative access, their
flexibility in terms of possible modifications and their useful
properties such as outstanding attenuation coefficients and also
high fluorescence quantum yields.2) Hence, they are already
widely applied for imaging, e.g. as biomarkers for medical
purposes, and have also proven to be applicable in other fields,
for instance as various types of photosensitizers and organic light-
emitting diodes (OLEDs).3) Various types of oligo-BODIPYS have
already shown the capability to enhance such desirable
properties and thus have been the focus of much recent
preparative chemistry. Alkylene bridged or directly connected

These types of connectivity have also been converted to extended ANomenclature
m-systems by oxidative follow-up reactions, allowing a higher level
of conjugation and hence strong bathochromic shifts.5) The
installation of heteroatoms has however been a challenge for
some time. In 2014, Shinokubo et al. presented linearly connect a: Pyrrole substitution pattern

were synthesized starting from unsymmetric mondfunctionalized

Results and Discussion

(Scheme 1).

In contrast to the aforementioned cyclic amine-linked examples, [8]
we have focused on selectively synthesizing open-chained
oligomers and addressing their specific properties. Variation of
the BODIPY core has been shown to have a considerable impact
on the respective reaction times and yields. To dimerize Br-Ar-mono-Br
selectively when forming the nitrogen bridge, monofunctionalized
a-chlorinated BODIPY monomers were used. The key step in
obtaining such unsymmetric BODIPYS (in contrast to the usual
mirror plane through the meso position and boron center) was a
Bischler-Napieralski type reaction of the respective chlorinated
acylpyrrole and alkylpyrrole, following an established procedure
developed by Dehaen and coworkers.9 Converting the a-chloro- C)Oligomerization
BODIPY into the respective amine and performing a Buchwald-
Hartwig coupling of both led to N-bridged BODIPY dimers, in
which alkylpyrroles such as 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (5) and
cryptopyrrole (6) serve as capping units on the BODIPY core.
Terminal a-brominated examples provide an option for further
versatile functionalization. During the investigation of meso
substitution patterns, the 4-iso-buty/phenyl moiety has been
shown to overcome solubility issues, while maintaining
crystallizability (albeit sometimes with disorder problems),
whereas dimer syntheses are made easier by an increasing level
of alkyl-substitution on the pyrrole motif. For a simplified overview
of the BODIPY scope, compounds are labeled according to the
systematic nomenclature shown in Scheme 1A.
The synthetic strategy began with pyrrole (1) for both kinds
of monomers. To obtain monochlorinated BODIPYs, it was first
converted into the respective 2-benzoylpyrrole 2 for the meso aryl
examples.10 TBS protection of the benzyl alcohol by- product in
the crude simplified the purification later on.1) This species and
2-acetylpyrrole were then chlorinated using NCS in THF at room

oxidation with DDQ, gave the crude dipyrrin, which was used in
the following step after filtration. The actual BODIPY synthesis
was subsequently conducted in a similar manner as for the
unsymmetric monomers. However, Pr2NEt was found to give
higher yields for less substituted dipyrrins. Thus, using this tertiary C)
amine base, in lieu of triethylamine, together with BF3-OEtz gave
Br-Ar-mono-Br in 38% yield over three steps. Bromination was
necessary in this case because the corresponding chlorinated
derivative of an a-amino-BODIPY showed no oligomerization
beyond the dimer under the same conditions. Additionally,
purification was not an obstacle, in contrast to the aforementioned
brominated acylpyrroles. Preparative details of the chlorinated
amino-BODIPY are given in the Supporting Information. The
respective d-amino-BODIPYS were then synthesized by stirring
halogenated BODIPYS in an ammonia solution in MeOH (7 N) in
a sealed tube at 60 oC to furnish the target compounds in up to
58% yieldf for chlorinated derivatives and even in quantitative yield
for the brominated example (Scheme 1B). For Buchwald- Hartwig

showed a trend of improvement with increasing level of

homologs (Figure 4). This trend is accentuated for the tetramers,
where the absorption signature becomes intricate. However, the
intensified coiling in this case, where the terminal BODIPY units
start overlapping and thus forming a looped superstructure,
results in an exceptionally weak Si+-So excitation at 820 nm. The

Figure Cyclic voltammograms. Cyclic voltammetry (IUPAC convention) was
measured of 4 mM solutions in CH2Cl2 with TBAPF6 (0.4 M) in reference to a
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) with a scan rate of 200 mV/s (clockwise,
starting from 0 V) in steps of 1 mV at room temperature.

Conclusion

Ins summary, we have successfully developed a method to access
linearly amine-linked BODIPYS using Buchwald-Hartwig
conditions. Terminal Br substituents allowed elongation of the
chain by two further BODIPY subunits. X-ray structure analyses
revealed conjugation of the various subunits via the linking
nitrogen atom. Absorption spectra show significantly increased
attenuation coefficients for the oligomers in comparison to the
respective monomers, and also strong bathochromic shifts. DFT
calculations provided an insight into the electronic properties and
showed a decreasing HOMO/LUMO gap as well as increasing
oscillator strengths (fvalues) of the excited states with increasing
level of oligomerization. The computed orbital energies are also
closely consistent with cyclovoltammetric investigations,
demonstrating a more facile oxidation and reduction with
