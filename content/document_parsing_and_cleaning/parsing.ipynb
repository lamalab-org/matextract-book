    "An important part of data extraction pipelines is often converting inputs into a form that the text-based pipelines can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, this conversion involves that image inputs (e.g. scans of a paper) must be converted into text. \n",
    "This involves multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- characters must be recognized, this is known as [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (Optical Character Recognition)\n",
    "- the layout and reading order must be understood \n",
    "- relevant blocks of text must be extracted, cleaned and combined\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, this was often done using tools specialized for each of these steps (e.g., [`tesseract`](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), [`LayoutParser`](https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-parser)). New tools such as [`nougat`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nougat) or [`marker`](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker), however, allow to perform the entire process end-to-end.\n",
