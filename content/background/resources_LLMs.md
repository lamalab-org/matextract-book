### Transformers

Transformers have become the leading architecture for solving natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enabling the development of powerful language models. Introduced in the groundbreaking 2017 paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* by Google researchers, the Transformer architecture has transformed the field of NLP. To understand the fundamentals of Transformers, you can explore the resources shown below. *(Figure - The Transformer, model architecture.

### Attention

The concept of "attention" in deep learning emerged from the need to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences. Working word-by-word is not effective. To overcome this issue, attention mechanisms were introduced to give access to all sequence elements at each time step. The key is to select and determine which words are most important in a specific context. The transformer architecture uses an autonomous self-attenuation mechanism that solves the problem of accessing the entire sequence in constant time. To understand the attention mechanisms, you can explore the resources shown below. *(Figure - Computing the attention scores to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence.

* [Understanding the attention mechanism in sequence models](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/attention)

    Jeremy Jordan explains in this post the attention mechanism using numerous helpful diagrams and an accessible language style. The attention mechanism enables the decoder to search across the entire input sequence for information at each step during the output sequence generation. This is a key innovation in sequence-to-sequence neural network architectures because it significantly improves model performance.

### Tokenization and embeddings

Tokenization and embeddings are two essential steps in the data processing pipeline of LLMs. Tokens are the fundamental units of LLMs. Tokenization is the process of translating text into sequences of tokens and vice versa, breaking down the text into manageable pieces that the model can interpret. Once the text is tokenized, each token is mapped to an embedding vector. These embeddings are dense, low-dimensional, continuous vector representations that capture the semantic and syntactic meanings of tokens, allowing the model to understand the nuances of language. These vectors are learned during the modelâ€™s training process. For more information on tokenization and embeddings, you can explore the resources listed below. *(Figure - [Tiktokenizer](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/))*
