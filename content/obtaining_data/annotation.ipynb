    "## Data annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "For structured data extraction, it is indeed essential to define a structure into which the data is supposed to be stored. This process of defining and applying structure to data is often referred to as data annotation. The choice of data structure and format is crucial and can significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of your data extraction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for choosing a data structure\n",
    "While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, here are some key points to consider when deciding on a data structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested vs. flat: Certain formats like YAML or JSON are better at expressing dependencies and hierarchies compared to flat formats like CSV.\n",
    "- Verbosity and human readability: Some formats (e.g., XML) can be more verbose, which may affect readability.\n",
    "- Type annotations and documentation: It's best practice to include as much metadata as possible, including data types and descriptions.\n",
    "- Machine readability: Consider how easily the format can be parsed by various programming languages and tools.\n",
    "- Extensibility: Choose a format that allows for easy addition of new fields or structures as your data needs evolve.\n",
    "- Standardization: Consider if there are any industry-standard formats for your specific domain.\n",

    "### Additional aspects to consider\n",
    "#### Schema definition languages\n",
    "When working with complex data structures, it can be beneficial to use schema definition languages. These allow you to formally define your data structure, which can then be used for validation, documentation, and even code generation. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) for JSON.\n",
    "- [XSD (XML Schema Definition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/) for XML.\n",
    "- [LinkML (Linked data Modeling Language)](https://linkml.io) for various formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} LinkML\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "[LinkML (Linked data Modeling Language)](https://linkml.io) is a framework for modeling and working with structured data. It can be useful for structured data extraction using LLMs in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schema definition: LinkML allows you to define schemas for your data models, specifying classes, attributes, and relationships. This provides a structured foundation for extracting information.\n",
    "- Interoperability: It promotes interoperability between different data formats and systems, making it easier to integrate extracted data into various workflows.\n",
    "- Validation: LinkML schemas can be used to validate extracted data, ensuring it conforms to the defined structure and constraints.\n",
    "- Code generation: It can generate code in various languages (e.g., Python, Java) based on your schema, facilitating data manipulation and processing.\n",
    "- Semantic web integration: LinkML is compatible with semantic web technologies, allowing extracted data to be easily linked and integrated with existing knowledge graphs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic annotations\n",
    "Beyond just structuring data, consider adding semantic annotations. This involves linking your data to standardized vocabularies or ontologies, which can greatly enhance the interoperability and machine-readability of your data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using standard chemical identifiers (like InChI or SMILES) in your chemical formulas.\n",
    "- Linking temperature and pressure units to standard unit ontologies ([QUDT ontology](https://qudt.org)) or materials science ontologies ([EMMO](https://emmo-repo.github.io), [MatOnto](https://matportal.org/ontologies/MATONTO?p=classes)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling missing or uncertain data\n",
    "In real-world data extraction scenarios, you often encounter missing or uncertain data. Your annotation scheme should have a way to represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing data (e.g., null values, specific placeholders).\n",
    "- Uncertain data (e.g., confidence scores, possible value ranges).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Versioning\n",
    "If your data model is likely to evolve over time, consider how you'll handle versioning. This might involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Including version numbers in your schema.\n",
    "- Maintaining backwards compatibility.\n",
    "- Documenting changes between versions.\n"
