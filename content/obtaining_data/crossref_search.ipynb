    "At the start of the data extraction process you have to collect a set of potentially relevant data sources. Therefore, you could collect a dataset manually or use a tool to help to automate and speed up this process.\n",

    "The Crossref API is a very useful tool to collect the metadata of relevant articles. Besides the API there are multiple Python libraries available that make access to the API easier. One of these libraries is [crossrefapi](https://github.com/fabiobatalha/crossrefapi). As an example, 100 sources including metadata on the topic 'buchwald-hartwig coupling' are extracted and saved into a JSON file. "
