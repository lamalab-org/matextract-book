In synthesis planning, it is crucial to understand regioselectivity, or the preference of a reaction over competing reaction sites. Precisely predicting regioselectivity enables early exclusion of unproductive reactions and paves the way to designing high-yielding synthetic routes with minimal separation and material costs. However, it is still at emerging state to combine chemical knowledge and data-driven methods to make practical predictions for regioselectivity. At the same time, metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have profoundly transformed medicinal chemistry, and thus become one of the most frequently encountered types of reactions in synthesis planning. In this work, we for the first time introduce a chemical knowledge informed message passing neural network(MPNN) framework that directly identifies the intrinsic major products for metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with regioselective ambiguity. Integrating both first principle methods and data-driven methods, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 95.24\\% on the test set of eight typical metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction types, including Suzuki-Miyaura, Stille, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Hiyama, Kumada, Negishi, and Heck reactions, outperforming other commonly used model types. To integrate electronic effects with steric effects in regioselectivity prediction, we propose a quantitative method to measure the steric hindrance effect. Our steric hindrance checker can successfully identify regioselectivity induced solely by steric hindrance. Notably under practical scenarios, our model outperforms 6 experimental organic chemists with an average working experience of over 10 years in the organic synthesis industry in terms of predicting major products in regioselective cases. We have also exemplified the practical usage of our model by fixing routes designed by open-access synthesis planning software and improving reactions by identifying low-cost starting materials. To assist general chemists in making prompt decisions about regioselectivity, we have developed a free web-based AI-empowered tool.

Ward; Davide Bonifazi","abstract":"In this paper, we report on a one-step catalyst-transfer macrocyclization (CTM) reaction, based on the Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction, selectively affording only cyclic structures. This route offers a versatile and efficient approach to synthesize aza[1n]paracyclophanes (APCs) featuring diverse functionalities and lumens. The method operates at mild reaction temperatures (40 \u00b0C) and short reaction times (~2 h), delivering excellent isolated yields (>75% macrocycles) and up to 30% of the 6-membered cyclophane, all under non-high-dilution concentrations (35-350 mM). Structural insights into APCs reveal variations in product distribution based on different endocyclic substituents, with steric properties of exocyclic substituents having minimal influence on the macrocyclization. Aryl-type endocyclic substituents predominantly yield 6-membered macrocycles, while polycyclic aromatic units such as fluorene and carbazole favor 4-membered species. Experimental and computational studies support a proposed mechanism of ring-walking catalyst-transfer that promotes the macrocycle formation. It has been found that the macrocyclization is driven by the formation of cyclic conformers during the oligomerization step favoring an intramolecular C\u2013N bond formation that, depending on the cycle size, hinges on either pre-organization effect or kinetic increase of the reductive elimination step or a combination of the two. The CTM process exhibits a \"living\" behavior, facilitating sequential synthesis of other macrocycles by introducing relevant monomers, thus providing a practical synthetic platform for chemical libraries. Notably, CTM operates both under diluted and concentrated regimes, offering scalability potential, unlike typical macrocyclization reactions usually operating in the 0.1\u20131 mM range.","date":"2024-02-19","journal":"chemRxiv","categories":"Organic Chemistry; Catalysis; Polymer Science; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Organic Polymers; Polymerization (Polymers)","metrics":null,"license":"CC BY NC ND 4.0"}

For chemical yield predictions, a key task in chemical synthesis, an attributed graph neural network (AGNN) performs as good or better than the best previous models on two HTE datasets for the Suzuki and Buchwald-Hartwig reactions.
