Among them, DZC-600-2 had the highest total yield of 34.50%, which could be ascribed to the carbonization of the most original components with the help of ZnCl2 activators. In short, the yields of these carbons were acceptable for practical production.45 2.3. Porous Texture Studies. According to the results of CO2 capture performance, we selected partial porous carbons as representatives and measured the N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms (Figure 5).
According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification,46 all isotherms could be identified as the Type-I isotherms except for HKC-800-2, which belonged to a combination of Type-I and Type-IV. At P/P0 < 0.005, the N2 uptake of all carbons has a rapid increase, indicating abundant micropores, and then, there appeared a mild rise at 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.3 for HKC-700-2, HKC-800-2, and HKC-800-1, implying the presence of some mesopores, while the isotherms of DKC-600-2, BKC-600-2, and HKC-600-2 all kept constant at P/P0 > 0.01, suggesting almost no mesopores or macropores, and finally, all isotherms leveled off in the high P/P0 region. Notably, the N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms of HKC-800-2 revealed a prominent Type-H4 hysteresis loop due to the capillary condensation from some mesoporous structures.46 The structural parameters of these carbons are summarized in Table 1. DKC-600-2, BKC-600-2, and HKC600-2 prepared under the same activation conditions had different porosities; for example, their SBET was 511, 535, and 893 m2/g and their Vmicro was 0.17, 0.22, and 0.33 cm3/g, respectively. The results demonstrated that the two-step routes, especially the hydrothermally combined activation routes, could endow the porous carbons with higher SBET and Vmicro. Thus, the following study mainly focused on the HKC
materials from the third route. For HKC-600-2, HKC-700-2, and HKC-800-2, with the increase in activation temperature, SBET, Vtotal, Vmicro, and DA increased, and SBET and Vtotal of HKC-800-2 reached 1587 m2/g and 1.00 cm3/g, respectively.
They possessed mesopores with the pore size of 2−5 nm. The results were in accordance with the N2 adsorption isotherms.

2.5. CO2 Capture Capacity. The CO2 adsorption
isotherms of all porous carbons at 273 and 298 K were measured in the pressure range of 0−1 bar (Figures 7 and S6).
First, Figure 7a,b shows CO2 adsorption isotherms of these porous carbons prepared from three different routes. Their CO2 uptake changed from 80.0 to 161.1 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar and revealed that KOH-activated porous carbons had higher CO2 uptake compared with the corresponding ZnCl2activated porous carbons except for DKC-600-2 and DZC-6002, which can be attributed to the different activation mechanism and precursor features.23,30 Among KOH-activated porous carbons, BKC-600-2 had a CO2 uptake of 116.0 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar, which showed an increase of 31.1% relative to DKC-600-2 (88.5 mg/g). Similarly, the CO2 uptake of HKC-600-2 was 54.6 and 161.1 mg/g at 0.15 and 1 bar, at 273 K, respectively, with an increase of 114.1 and 82.0% compared to DKC-600-2. This clearly demonstrated that the bioethanol process and hydrothermal treatment were effective steps for improving CO2 adsorption of porous carbons.
The following study focused on the performance optimization of HKCs. With an increase of the activation temperature, the CO2 uptake at 273 K and 1.0 bar slightly decreased, and the values were 161.1, 124.5, and 151.6 mg/g corresponding to HKC-600-2, HKC-700-2, and HKC-800-2. HKC-800-2 had the highest SBET of 1587 m2/g, but the CO2 uptake was not the largest, implying that SBET was not the dominating factor. To achieve higher CO2 uptake, we selected HKC-600-2 and HKC800-2 for further optimization, and the previous references indicated that excess activators could lead to severe etching and the collapse of the micropore structure.38,47 Hence, HKC600-1 and HKC-800-1 were prepared by reducing the amount of activators, and the CO2 uptake of both reached 146.5 and 217 mg/g, respectively, suggesting that the appropriate activation dosage was very important at a high temperature.
The CO2 uptake of these porous carbons is summarized in Table 2. For ZnCl2-activated porous carbons, with an increase of the activation temperature (Table S2 and Figure S6), the CO2 uptake first increased and then slightly decreased, and the values were 90.3, 120.2, and 113.8 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar. At 298 K and 1 bar, the CO2 uptake values of all porous carbons were in the range of 48.6−126.1 mg/g.
The CO2 uptake and textural properties of these porous carbons were compared with various carbon materials (Tables 3 and S3). Among free N-doped porous carbons, HKC-800-1 shows superior CO2 adsorption of 217 mg/g relative to

g),49 OM-CNS (175.1 mg/g),50 CA-HC200 (198.4 mg/g),51 and PC500 (190.5 mg/g),52 and it was also comparable with PMMC-800 (237.6 mg/g),53 NET2-2-700-2 (228.8 mg/g),54 and L2600 (233.2 mg/g).36 Compared with these N-doped porous carbons, such as salt-templated carbons with arginine
(147.8 mg/g),56 FC4 (178.2 mg/g),57 OTSS-1-550 (191.4 mg/g),58 N-PHCS-900 (194.5 mg/g),59 microporous carbon from fern leaves (198.9 mg/g),60 and PDA0.3/MA0.7-2 (202.4 mg/g),62 the CO2 uptake of our porous carbons was also decent. HKC-800-1 was also comparable with c-CBAP-1N
(223.5 mg/g),66 H150-800 (228.1 mg/g),67 NPC500 (235.8 mg/g),52 Bamboo-1-973 (233.2 mg/g),33 and AC-KOH-W-2700 (237.6 mg/g).68 Of course, the CO2 uptake of HKC-800-1 was inferior to those of some advanced carbon materials including ACDS-800-2 (264 mg/g),70 CMS-K3 (286.4 mg/
g),71 and CSC-650 (295.7 mg/g).72 To deeply understand the CO2 adsorption behavior, two adsorption models (Langmuir and Freundlich) were used to simulate the CO2 adsorption isotherms (Figure S7), and Table S4 summarizes these parameters such as Qm, KL, KF, and the correlation coefficient
(R2). At 273 K, the Langmuir and Freundlich models both could well fit CO2 adsorption isotherms with R2 > 0.99, and the Freundlich model exhibited better fitting with a higher R2.
Qmax of HKC-800-2 and HKC-800-1 reached 425.3 and 450.7 mg/g at 273 K, respectively, and this was because their higher SBET would provide more adsorption sites under high pressure.
In addition, HKC-600-1 had higher KL and KF at 273 K,
suggesting stronger affinity for CO2 molecules, and this parameter with n > 2 implied preferential adsorption. To
 
further investigate the relationship between CO2 uptake and structural properties, SBET, V(d<1.0 nm), Vtotal, and O content were plotted with the CO2 uptake, respectively (Figures 8 and S8).
The CO2 uptake of these porous carbons at 273 K and 1.0 bar, 273 K and 0.15 bar, and 298 K and 1.0 bar exhibited the same trend with the increase of SBET, respectively, which indicated that SBET had a similar effect on the CO2 uptake under the above adsorption conditions. It has been reported that Vmicro is an important factor that determines CO2 uptake; especially, the micropores with 2−3 times the pore size of the diameter of CO2 molecules (0.33 nm) would maximally enhance the adsorption potential.34,47,54,60 Then, Vmicro (d <
1.0 nm) was linearly fitted with the CO2 uptake, and the correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.8352 (at 273 K and 1 bar),
0.7239 (at 273 K and 0.15 bar), and 0.7580 (at 298 K and 1 bar), implying that Vmicro (d < 1.0 nm) had an evident positive effect on CO2 uptake, and the results were also in accordance with some previous reports.47,54,60 Meanwhile, the importance of the ultramicropores with d < 0.7 nm has been pointed out in some recent references. The ultramicropore volumes (Vultra) of these carbons are summarized in Table 1. DKC-600-2, BKC600-2, and HKC-700-2 did not have ultramicropores, but Vultra of HKC-600-2, HKC-800-2, and HKC-800-1 was 0.0064, 0.017, and 0.088 cm3/g, respectively. The relationship between Vultra and CO2 uptake (at 273 or 298 K and 1 bar) is plotted in Figure S9, and we found that HKC-800-2 with the largest Vultra had the highest CO2 uptake, and the CO2 uptake of these carbons without ultramicropores was lower than those of other carbons with ultramicropores. Hence, the importance of ultramicropores was verified again. In addition, Vtotal was also used to plot the CO2 uptake; the curves of Vtotal vs CO2 uptake were similar to SBET vs CO2 uptake. Generally, the O content of these porous carbons would inherently affect the acidity/
basicity of carbon materials, and basic groups containing pyrone, chromene, and diketone/quinone type of structures could be beneficial for CO2 adsorption.73 Here, the O content of these porous carbons seemingly did not have a regular relationship with the CO2 uptake (Figure S8), and HKC-800-2 with the highest O content did not appear to have a large enhancement of the CO2 uptake relative to HKC-700-2 with the lowest O content. The results suggested that the O doping may not be effective enough at improving CO2 capture under the dominant effect of microporosity, and previous references also showed similar results.52,54 2.6. Sensibility of Adsorption Temperature, Isosteric Heat of CO2 Adsorption (Qst), and Recycling. Considering the higher operating temperature in the adsorption of CO2 from industrial flue gases, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of HKC-800-1 at five adsorption temperatures (273−343 K)
were measured (Figure 9a). The change of CO2 uptake represented its sensibility of adsorption temperature. It can be seen that the adsorption isotherms moved down with increasing adsorption temperature and basically kept unchanged at 323 and 343 K, and the values of CO2 uptake at 1.0 and 0.15 bar under different adsorption temperatures clearly showed the change (Figure 9b). The results indicated that HKC-800-1 had good stability of CO2 adsorption at a high adsorption temperature. We think that the larger number of ultramicropores of HKC-800-1 can capture a constant number of CO2 molecules due to its strong adsorption even at high
temperatures, and thus its adsorption capacity almost has no loss in a certain temperature range.
To investigate the interaction strength between these carbons and CO2, the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 273 and 298 K were used to calculate Qst by the Clausius−Clapeyron equation (Figures 10 and S10). For ZnCl2-activated carbons, DZC-600-2 had a larger Qst (28.3 kJ/mol) compared with BZC-600-2 (22.7 kJ/mol) and HZC-600-2 (21.1 kJ/mol). For KOH-activated carbons, the Qst curves of HKC-600-2 and HKC-600-1 evidently decreased with an increase of CO2 loading due to the heterogeneous adsorption sites, and thus the remaining weak sites made Qst decrease. The initial Qst of DKC-600-2, BKC-600-2, and HKC-600-2 was 26.4, 28.1, and 37.0 kJ/mol, respectively, which was less than 40 kJ/mol, ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article suggesting a physical adsorption process. In addition, the initial Qst of all HKCs (Figure 10b) decreased with the increase of activation temperature; especially, Qst of HKC-600-1 reached 43.2 kJ/mol, suggesting the possibly existing weak chemical interaction. The initial Qst of the above activated carbons
(21.1−43.2 kJ/mol) exceeded the heat of liquefaction of CO2
(17 kJ/mol),67 and Qst of these carbons at low CO2 loading were comparable, even higher than many other carbon-based adsorbents, such as OM-CNS (28.4 kJ/mol),50 PMMC-800 (∼24.5 kJ/mol),53 NET2-2-700-2 (23.2 kJ/mol),54 AcA5 (∼29.7 kJ/mol),55 FC4 (24.9 kJ/mol),57 and CSC-650 (25.8 kJ/mol).72 Fortunately, HKC-800-1 with the highest CO2 uptake had a moderate Qst of 24.9 kJ/mol, which was beneficial to easy regeneration and good cycling of adsorbents.
The reclaimed HKC-800-1 was degassed at 30 °C for 30 min before the next cycle, and the reusability was measured (Figure 10c). After the first cycle, the values of CO2 uptake at 273 K
and 1 bar had slightly decreased due to the difficult desorption of some CO2 molecules and the influence of impurities possibly, but the CO2 adsorption isotherms were almost coincidental in the following four cycles and had no loss. This result indicated the acceptable recyclability. HKC-800-1 as a CO2 adsorbent could be used in pressure, vacuum swing adsorption (P/VSA) processes.
2.7. CO2/N2 Selectivity. The CO2/N2 selectivity is also an important index for CO2 capture. The N2 adsorption isotherms of all samples were measured at 273 K (Figure S11). The N2 uptake of these carbons was in the range of 2.8−15.7 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar. DKC-600-2 has a higher N2 uptake of 15.7 mg/g, which was about one-sixth of CO2 uptake (88.5 mg/g),
implying low selectivity. Other microporous carbons have a lower ratio of N2 uptake to CO2 uptake, implying higher selectivity. To evaluate the CO2/N2 selectivity in practical applications, the selectivity at 273 K was calculated by the initial slope method (Henry's law) and ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST).74 These results are summarized in Table 2 and Figures S2,S5,S12, and S13. For Henry's law selectivity, the values of these microporous carbons were in the range of 3.84−44.0. DZC-600-2 (26.16) had higher selectivity relative to DKC-600-2 (3.84), while BKC-600-2 had (44.0) higher selectivity compared to BZC-600-2 (8.66), implying that the synthetic route also had an important effect on the CO2/N2 selectivity apart from the activator. Among all HKC carbons, HKC-800-1 had the highest CO2/N2 selectivity of 27.93, which could benefit from its highest Vmicro and V(d<1 nm).
