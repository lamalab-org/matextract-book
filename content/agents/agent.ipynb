    "First, it's worth noting that the model's reasoning about the tool use is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct prompt's reasoning enables the agent to correctly identify and provide information only about the reactants, contrary to the previous case. For compound number 12 in the image, p-tolyl(ethyl)ketene, the agent provided the correct SMILES and InChI representation but did not return any IUPAC name.\n",
    "Upon examining the agent's reasoning, it becomes evident that one of the strong points about the agents is their ability to handle errors. In this specific case, the error is related to the `smiles_to_iupac_converter` tool. The agent attempted to resolve the error once, and upon seeing that the error persisted, it moved on to the next molecule. As for the second reactant, compound number 13, 2-(tert-Butyl)phenol, all the variables in the answer are incorrect. Upon examining the agent's reasoning, it becomes clear that the `image_extractor` tool returned the wrong SMILES representation.\n",
    "This is unfortunate because for the other two nomenclatures, IUPAC and InChI, the agent's output is consistent with the SMILES representation provided by the first tool, all referring to the isobutylphenol molecule. The error from the `image_extractor` tool is not easy to solve since it depends on an external package with a specific pre-training. However, it is possible to see that using an agent allows us to introspect and find this error, which would be more difficult if the process were based on programming.\n"
