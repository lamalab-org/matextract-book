            "Since Tang and co-workers firstly demonstrated that the use of hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for hole injection from the anodes into the light-emitting layer could provides the significant improvement of the OLED device performance [1], much attention have been devoted to the development of new hole-transporting materials [2] in recent years. Recently, small molecule weight triarylamine derivatives have attracted much interest as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for use in multilayer OLEDs [3\u20135] due to their high mobility and are easily oxidized to form stable radical cations that act as hole-transporting species. Furthermore, they are easily purified by vapor deposition techniques or column chromatography and uniform thin film can be prepared by simple coating techniques. Examples of triarylamine-based HTM are 4,4\u2032-bis(m-tolylphenylamino) of biphenyl (TPD) [6\u20138], bistriphenylamine end-capped oligothiophenes [9], spiro-silabifluorene [10,11] and bi-furyl derivatives [12], and dithioenosilole [13] and dicarbazolyl [14] derivatives containing peripheral triarylamines. Moreover, for practical OLED devices, a simple structure hole-transporting material (HTM) with high mobility of hole, stable amorphous state, easy form good thin film by spin-coating techniques, and preferable a simple preparation is necessary. Therefore, there are continually research interest in the design and synthesis of new HTMs materials with excellent properties.",
            "As a large conjugated aromatic ring, pyrene not only has the advantages of high PL efficiency [15], high carrier mobility, but also has the much improved hole-injection ability than oligofluorenes or polyfluorene [16]. More recently, some pyrene derivatives have been successfully used in OLEDs to improve hole-transporting ability arising from their electron-rich property [17,18].",
            "Thus there is substantial interest in investigating new pyrene derivatives with excellent properties as promising candidates for high-performance OLEDs applications. Recently, pyrene-based materials for organic electronics, which include the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions bromopyrenes were widely developed [19]. In this paper, we wish to report here the synthesis of three types of pyrene derivatives that combined the high hole mobility function of diarylamine as substituents with the high efficiency and hole-injection ability of pyrene as the conjugation core, by using a modified Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination reaction. Moreover, photophysical properties of these compounds are fully examined in solution through spectroscopy techniques."

            "1-Bromopyrene 2 was prepared by brominating of pyrene 1 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF at room temperature for 24h according to the previous reported procedure [20]. Bromination of pyrene 1 with 1.1 equivalents of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBMH) [22] in CH2Cl2 at room temperature for 1h afforded a mixture of 1,6-di- and 1,8-dibromopyrene 3 and 4 in yield of 97%. 1,3,6,8-Tetrabromopyrene 5 was readily obtained by the exhaustive bromination of pyrene 1 with 4.5 equivalents of bromine in nitrobenzene at 120\u00b0C for 12h as following the previous reported procedures (Scheme 1 ) [24]. Although attempted separation of the mixture of 1,6- and 1,8-dibromopyrene (3 and 4) into each pure failed, the mixture of isomers of 1,6-di- and 1,8-dibromopyrene (3 and 4) was directly used to carry out next Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination reaction using the \u2013C\u2013N\u2013 as linked bridge.",
            "The Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination reactions were carried out between the 1-bromopyrene 2, 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene 5 and the diphenylamines 6 under the modified reaction conditions [25,26] to afford the targets 1-(N,N-diarylamino)- and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis-(N,N-diarylamino)-subsituted pyrenes 7(a/b) and 10(a/b) in good yields, respectively. Similarly, the mixture of 3 and 4 was reacted with the diphenylamines 6a and 6b afforded 8a/9a and 8b/9b in 68% and 73% yields, respectively (Scheme 1). Both the 1-substituted pyrenes (7a/b) and the tetra-subsituted pyrenes (10a/b) were successfully purified by column chromatography and recrystallization. Although several attempted isolations of the mixture of 1,6- and 1,8-bis-substituted pyrenes (8a/8b and 9a/9b) in each pure form failed, the two mixtures of compounds, 8a/9a and 8b/9b were directly used to determine their photophysical properties.",
            "The structures of these new diarylamino-functionalized pyrene derivatives 7\u201310 were fully characterized by 1H/13C NMR, mass spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. In particular, due to their C 2 h point-group symmetric structures, their 1H NMR spectrum of these tetra-substituted pyrene derivatives 10a and 10b are very simple, for example, the compound 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N,N-di-(4-methylphenyl)]pyrene 10b display two singlet at \u03b4 =7.93ppm and 7.57ppm for the pyrene ring protons at 4-, 5-, 9-, and 10-positions and 2-, 7-positions, respectively, a pair of doublets in a 1:1 ratio in the region at \u03b4 =6.93 and \u03b4 =6.85ppm for the aromatic protons, a singlet at \u03b4 =2.35ppm for the eight methyl groups protons. Simultaneously, the structures of 7\u201310 were further established on the basis of the base peak molecular ion at m/z [M+] 369 for 7a, 397 for 7b, 537 for 8a/9a, 593 for 8b/9b, 871 for 10a, and 983 for 10b in their mass spectrum, respectively. All results were well consistent with the proposed structures. On the other hand, these three types of diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes 7\u201310 are very stable solids with colors of from orange to red that can be stored in air for prolonged period of times at room temperature. All compounds have good solubility in all the common organic solvents including hexane with melting points from 176\u00b0C to over 300\u00b0C, increasing as the number of the diarylamino-substituents.",
            "The molecular structure of compound 10a was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The crystals were grown by slow evaporation of a CHCl3 concentrated solution. This compound was obtained as orange needles and provided excellent quality data. The crystallographic data for this compound 10a are summarized in Table 1 .",
            "Structure diagrams of 10a are shown in Fig. 1 i and ii. The molecule lies on a onefold axis; thus all is crystallographically unique. The four diphenylamino groups are completely twisted against the central pyrene ring with certain angles. Generally, the efficient \u03c0-stacking in emitting molecules could lead to extensive excimer formation in the solid state or thin film with low quantum yields of fluorescence. The crystal packing diagrams of 10a are also shown in Fig. 1iii. No crystal packings were observed in this crystal due to the big sterically hindrance arising from the bulky diphenylamino groups attached in the pyrene ring at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions. Thus, these newly prepared diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes with less \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking intermolecular interactions suggests that they might be advantageous as promising emitters in optoelectronic device applications.",
            "The UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of these three types of diarylamino-substituted pyrenes 7\u201310 were measured in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and the key photophysical data are listed in Table 2 .",
            "The spectroscopic properties of these diarylamino-functionalized pyrene derivatives 7\u201310 were measured in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solution at 25\u00b0C and are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively.",
            "As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption spectra of 7\u201310 showed a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 * band at \u223c379\u2013472nm. Consequently, for the 1-(N,N-diarylamino)-substituted pyrenes, the absorption maxima of 7a (379nm) and 7b (407nm) are red-shifted ca. 40nm and 70nm compared with that of unsubstituted pyrene 1 (336nm), for the isomer of 1,6-bis- and 1,8-bis-(N,N-diphenylamino)-substituted pyrenes (8a/9a) and (8b/9b), the absorption spectra maxima (422nm for 8a/9a and 431nm for 8b/9b) are red-shifted ca. 80 and 90nm relative to that of unsubstituted pyrene 1, respectively, and the 1,3,6,8-tetrakis-(N,N-diphenylamino)-substituted pyrenes 10a and 10b, the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 * maxima band were observed at 461 and 472nm, respectively, which are gradually red-shifted ca. 120nm and 130nm compared to that of unsubstituted pyrene 1, respectively. Furthermore, there is a slight red-shift in the absorption spectra of 7b relative to that of 7a, which can be ascribed to the electron-donating ability of methyl groups. Similar results can also be observed in the absorption spectra of 8/9 and 10. Thus, these results strongly indicate that not only the number of substituents but also the difference of substituents characteristics can significantly affect the spectroscopic properties of these diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes.",
            "The fluorescence-emission spectra of 7\u201310 are shown in Fig. 3. Dilute solutions of 7\u201310 in dichloromethane showed sky-blue to green emission as the number of substituent increased. It is interesting that the compounds that have methyl groups (7b, 8b/9b and 10b) showed significantly red-shifted fluorescence relative to those that have no methyl groups (7a, 8a/9a and 10a). On the other hand, the emission maxima of 7a, 8a/9a, and 10a, consecutively shifted to longer wavelengths at 464, 481 and 494nm, in a manner similar to their absorption maxima and the fluorescence spectra of 7b, 8b/9b and 10b, are also varied at 474, 494 and 500nm, respectively, also in agreement with the electronic absorption spectra. These phenomena can also be observed in some carbazole-based dendrimers [27] and several phenylethynyl-substituted pyrene derivatives [28,29]. The fluorescence spectrum of 10b was the most red-shifted among all the compounds examined (Table 2).",
            "The fluorescence quantum yields (\u03a6f ) of 7\u201310 recorded in dichloromethane are also presented in Table 2. The \u03a6f values of 7\u201310 were found in the range of 0.84\u20130.96 relative to that of 9,10-diphenylanthracene (0.90 in cyclohexane) [29].",
            "To obtain better understanding of the electronic spectroscopic properties of these diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes, the 1-substituted pyrene 7b and the tetrakis-substituted pyrene 10b were selected as the candidates, and the optical absorption and emission spectroscopic data of 7b and 10b recorded in various solvents are summarized in Table 3 .",
            "It is well known that the solvatochromitic effect is not only depends on the molecular structure, but also depends on the nature of the chromophore, and the solvents [30]. Each molecule shows a certain solvatochromic behavior (Figs. 4 and 5 ). The emission spectrum exhibits a more significant red shift in polar solvents than in nonpolar solvents (see Table 3). For example, the emission maxima of 7a in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (504nm) is ca. 64nm red-shifted from that in cyclohexane (440nm) (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the emission maxima of 10b gradually increases (ca. 20nm) going from cyclohexane (490nm) to DMF (510nm) (Fig. 5B). This solvatochromism can be attributed to the decease in the energy of the singlet excited states as a function of an increase in the polarity of the solvents.",
            "Typically, a fluorophore has a larger dipole moment in the excited state than in the ground state. Following excitation, solvent dipoles can reorient or relax lowing the energy of the excited state [30]. So, these results above observed indicated that the \u03bce (dipole moment of 7b and 10b in the excited state) should be larger than the \u03bcg (the dipole moment of 7b and 10b in the ground state) because a positive solvatochromic effect was observed. On the other hand, the solvatochromic effect indicates the compounds possess intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor (diarylamine) to the acceptor (pyrene center) units [31]. Interestingly, although compound 10b has a more number of substituent, it shows less solvatochromic shift compared with that of compound 7b. This may be due to 10b bearing more symmetrical than 7b, which results in lower excited dipole of 10b getting less stabilization by the solvent dipole [32].",
            "These results further indicated that the \u03bce (the dipole moments of 7 and 10 in the excited state) should be the little larger than the \u03bcg (the dipole moments of 7 and 10 in the ground state) because the positive solvatochromic effects were observed in both the absorption spectra and the emission spectra [33,34]. Although the dipole moments of 10 in either the ground or excited states are indeed zero because they are possessed centre-symmetric in the ideal C 2 h symmetry, these results obtained above demonstrated that the Qe (the quadrupole moments of 10 in the excited state) should be larger than the Qg (the quadrupole moments of 10 in the ground state) because the positive solvatochromic effects were observed in both the absorption spectra and the emission spectra, which implies that there is a change in the quadropole moment upon excitation [35]. On the other hand, the fact that solvatochromic effects are more important for emission than for absorption suggests that these diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes are more solvated in the excited state than in the ground state [36]."

        "Conclusions": [
            "A series of diarylamino-functionalized pyrenes 7\u201310 have been synthesized in high yields by a modified Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination reaction. Photophysical properties studies of 7\u201310 indicated that there are significant effects on the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra and the emission spectra as the number of diarylamino-substituent increased. All compounds 7\u201310 emit very bright fluorescent emissions, from sky-blue to green in solution (\u03a6f =0.84\u20130.96 in dichloromethane), and have good solubility in common organic solvents and high stability. Slight solvatochromic effects can be observed for the mono-diarylamino-substituted pyrenes 7 and the tetra-diarylamino-substituted pyrenes 10 in solutions, which imply that these current compounds 7 and 10 are more solvated in the excited state than in the ground state. The herein-presented molecules are exciting new materials that combine excellent optical features and an improved thermal stability. Thus, their potential applications in OLEDs can be suggested and further explorations into this area are currently under study in our laboratory."
