    "Following data extraction, it is crucial to implement automated checks to ensure the validity of the extracted data. One effective validation method involves matching the extracted NMR spectra to the corresponding analyzed molecule. This process compares the number of protons and peaks in the molecule's theoretical NMR spectra with those in the extracted NMR spectra. This approach is similar to that employed by {cite:t}`Patiny_2023`.\n",

    "One could use the matching of hydrogen atoms and number of peaks as a validation of the extracted data. Since hydrogen atoms with a very similar environment could appear in an NMR spectra as one overlapped peak, the calculated number of peaks could deviate from the observed one. To meet this challenge, one could score the extracted datapoints based on their deviation from the calculated values. For example, if one molecule does not have a matching peak number and hydrogen number, one could delete the datapoint. If just one value mismatches, one could give this datapoint a lower weight for model training. "
