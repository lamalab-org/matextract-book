    "After the data extraction one should have automated checks to asure the validity of the data. One possible validation check could be to match the extracted NMR spectra to the extracted analyzed molecule. Therefore, one could compare the number of protons and peaks in NMR spectra of the molecule and in the extracted NMR spectra. In this notebook we show an example of how one could do this automated check. "

Since Hydrogen atoms with a very similar environment could appear in an NMR spectra as one overlapped peak the calculated number of peaks could deviate from the observed one. To meet this challenge one could score the extracted datapoints based on their deviation from the calculated values. For example if one molecule does not have a matching peak number and hydrogen number one could delete the datapoint. If just one value mismatches one could give these datapoint a lower weight for model training. "
