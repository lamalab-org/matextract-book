    "When comparing all the results, it can be clearly seen that the zero-shot fine-tuned model gives the best results overall, with an F$_1$-score exceeding 0.95.\n",

    "Additionally, it is evident that the one-shot prompt yields better results for the not fine-tuned models compared to the zero-shot prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to highlight the underwhelming results of the fine-tuned model when using the one-shot prompt. This is due to the fact that during the fine-tuning process, the model becomes highly adapted to a specific format, which is disrupted when using the one-shot prompt. Typically, few-shot prompts are not used with the fine-tuned model for this reason.\n",

    "Lastly, it is crucial to acknowledge that the small differences observed may be attributed to the evaluation method. The BERTScore method measures token-by-token similarity, which may not be very reliable when applied to a JSON schema containing numerous curly brackets and other schema-related tokens. For more reliable evaluations, please refer to the [evaluations notebook](../evaluations/evaluations.ipynb)."
