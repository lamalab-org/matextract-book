Extract information from it to an ORD JSON record.\n\n### Procedure:\n105 mg of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added to a solution of 156 mg of 2-(RS)-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,3-dihydro-5-benzyloxy-4,6,7 -trimethylbenzofurane in 0.5 ml cooled to 0\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture is stirred for 3 hours, then it is acidified and extracted. The organic extracts are dried and evaporated, thus giving 185 mg of raw product, which is then purified with chromatography (SiO2). 153 mg of p-toluenesulfonate of 2[2,3-dihydro-5-benzyloxy-4,6,7-trimethyl-2-(RS)benzofuranyl]ethyl are obtained. IR (KBr): 1359, 1177 cm-1 (\u03bdSO2). The product thus obtained is then solubilized in 2 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofurane and added to a suspension of 45 mg of lithium and aluminum hydride in 5 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofurane. The reaction mixture is stirred in an inert atmosphere for 30 minutes. The reaction process is carried out using the same procedure described in example 1. 82 mg of a white solid are obtained. m.p. 65\u00b0-67\u00b0 C.

Extract information from it to an ORD JSON record.\n\n### Procedure:\nTo a solution of 1,5-dimethyltetrazole (4.6 g, 4.7 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) at -50\u00b0 C. was added butyl lithium solution (21.4 mL of a 2.2 M solution, 4.7 mmoles). After stirring for 10 minutes, a solution of 2,2'-difluoro-4,4'-dimethylbenzophenone in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) was added. The solution was stirred for 2.5 hours during which time it was allowed to warm to -10\u00b0 C. The reaction was quenched by adding 1N hydrochloric acid.

After bubbling nitrogen through the suspension for 30 minutes, 1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)Ferrocenedichloropalladium(II) (49 mg, 0.054 mmol) was added. The system was subjected to three cycles of vacuum/argon flush and heated at 80\u00b0 C. for 3 h. It was then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The solid was washed with dichloromethane (2\u00d720 mL). The combined filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography eluting with dichloromethane/methanol (40:1 to 10:1) to afford 185c (90 mg, 29%) as a light yellow solid.

Extract information from it to an ORD JSON record.\n\n### Procedure:\nA vigorously stirred mixture of 4-tolylboronic acid (34 g, 0.25 mol) and 2-bromo-1-nitrobenzene (34 g, 0.168 mol) in a mixture of 5N sodium hydroxide (170 mL), water (57 mL), isopropanol (215 mL) and benzene (1080 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere was treated with (tetrakis)triphenylphosphine palladium (0) (11.9 g). The stirred bilayer reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 3 hours. The cooled reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the filter cake washed with fresh benzene.

Extract information from it to an ORD JSON record.\n\n### Procedure:\nTo a cooled stirring solution of 4-(3-fluoro-2-nitro-phenyl)-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (1.50 g, 4.61 mmol), and 2-(methylsulfonyl)ethanol (876 mg, 6.92 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (15 mL), under nitrogen, was added, portionwise, sodium hydride (553 mg, 13.8 mmol, 60% oil dispersion). The solution foamed upon the sodium hydride addition. The resulting dark orange solution was stirred, at 0\u00b0 C., for 30 minutes upon completion of sodium hydride addition. The reaction solution became viscous and additional DMF (5 mL) was added, via syringe, the ice bath removed and the dark solution stirred at room temperature, under nitrogen, for 2 h. The reaction was cooled in an ice bath, quenched with 0.1N hydrochloric acid solution, and transferred to a separatory funnel with ethyl acetate (100 mL). This organic phase was washed with brine (75 mL\u00d73). The aqueous washings were combined and extracted with ethyl acetate (75 mL\u00d73). The organic extracts were combined and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), brine (100 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed to give an amber colored oil (2.21 g). This oil was adsorbed onto silica and purified by column chromatography, eluting with 50% ethyl acetate in hexane to afford the product as a light yellow colored solid (1.37 g, 92%).

After stirring for 1 h, the solvent was removed in vacuo. A portion of the residue (8.92 g, 35.5 mmol) was suspended in dichloromethane (95 mL) and oxalyl chloride (4 mL, 45 mmol) was added, followed by a couple of drops of N,N-dimethylformamide. After stirring for 1 h, the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in dichloromethane (45 mL) and added to a solution of 2-amino-N-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-5-iodobenzamide (8.86 g, 23.7 mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (5 mL, 28 mmol), and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (0.33 g, 2.7 mmol) in dichloromethane (50 mL). After stirring 19 h, the reaction mixture was partitioned between dichloromethane and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was slurried in diethyl ether and filtered to give 8.6 g (62%) of a pink solid.\n\n### ORD JSON:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": {\n    \"m1_m3\": {\n      \"components\": [\n        {\n          \"reaction_role\": \"REACTANT\",\n          \"name\": \"1-Boc-isonipecotic acid\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"reaction_role\": \"SOLVENT\",\n          \"name\": \"methanol\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"m2\": {\n      \"components\": [\n        {\n          \"reaction_role\": \"REACTANT\",\n          \"name\": \"sodium methoxide\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"stirring\": {\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"type\": \"CUSTOM\",\n        \"details\": \"After stirring for 1 h\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"conditions\": {\n      \"type\": \"CUSTOM\",\n      \"details\": \"the solvent was removed in vacuo\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"workups\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADDITION\",\n      \"details\": \"A portion of the residue (8.92 g, 35.5 mmol) was suspended in dichloromethane (95 mL)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADDITION\", \"details\": \"oxalyl chloride (4 mL, 45 mmol) was added\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"STIRRING\", \"details\": \"After stirring for 1 h\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"the solvent was removed in vacuo\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ADDITION\", \"details\": \"added to a solution of 2-amino-N-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-5-iodobenzamide (8.86 g, 23.7 mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (5 mL, 28 mmol), and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (0.33 g, 2.7 mmol) in dichloromethane (50 mL)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"STIRRING\", \"details\": \"After stirring 19 h\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"the reaction mixture was partitioned between dichloromethane and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"DRY_WITH_MATERIAL\", \"details\": \"The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate\", \"input\": {\n        \"components\": [\n          {\n            \"reaction_role\": \"WORKUP\",\n            \"name\": \"magnesium sulfate\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"FILTRATION\", \"details\": \"filtered\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"CONCENTRATION\", \"details\": \"concentrated in vacuo\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"FILTRATION\", \"details\": \"filtered\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"outcomes\": [\n    {\n      \"products\": [\n        {\n          \"reaction_role\": \"PRODUCT\",\n          \"name\": \"pink solid\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\nYou are a helpful scientific assistant.

The majority of the reaction solvent was removed by vacuum distillation (120 torr, 70\u00b0-80\u00b0 C.) and the residue was neutralised with aqueous potassium carbonate (5%; 40 ml), washed with water (2\u00d7100 ml) and extracted into chloroform (40 ml). The chloroform extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and subjected to column chromatography (chloroform:methanol 25:1) to give the title compound as an oil (1.15 g). This was treated with oxalic acid as in Example 1 to give 2-[3-[3-(piperidinomethyl)phenoxy]propylamino]-3-chloropyridine dioxalate (1.1 g), m.p. 154\u00b0-5\u00b0 C.\n\n### ORD JSON:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": {\n    \"m1_m2_m3\": {\n      \"components\": [\n        {\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"3-[3-(Piperidinomethyl)phenoxy]propylamine\"}], \"amount\": {\"mass\": {\"value\": 2.17, \"units\": \"GRAM\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"REACTANT\"},\n        {\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"2,3-dichloropyridine\"}], \"amount\": {\"mass\": {\"value\": 1.27, \"units\": \"GRAM\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"REACTANT\"},\n        {\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"3-methylpyridine\"}], \"amount\": {\"volume\": {\"value\": 6.0, \"units\": \"MILLILITER\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"SOLVENT\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"stirring\": {\"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"stirred\"},\n    \"conditions\": {\"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"under reflux for 16 hours\"}\n  },\n  \"workups\": [\n    {\"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"The majority of the reaction solvent was removed by vacuum distillation (120 torr, 70\\u00b0-80\\u00b0 C.)\", \"input\": {\"components\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"reaction solvent\"}], \"reaction_role\": \"WORKUP\"}]}},\n    {\"type\": \"WASH\", \"details\": \"washed with water (2\\u00d7100 ml)\", \"input\": {\"components\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"water\"}], \"amount\": {\"volume\": {\"value\": 100.0, \"units\": \"MILLILITER\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"WORKUP\"}]}},\n    {\"type\": \"EXTRACTION\", \"details\": \"extracted into chloroform (40 ml)\", \"input\": {\"components\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"chloroform\"}], \"amount\": {\"volume\": {\"value\": 40.0, \"units\": \"MILLILITER\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"WORKUP\"}]}},\n    {\"type\": \"EXTRACTION\", \"details\": \"The chloroform extract\", \"input\": {\"components\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"chloroform\"}], \"reaction_role\": \"WORKUP\"}]}},\n    {\"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"was evaporated under reduced pressure\"}\n  ],\n  \"outcomes\": [\n    {\"products\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"title compound\"}], \"measurements\": [{\"type\": \"AMOUNT\", \"details\": \"MASS\", \"amount\": {\"mass\": {\"value\": 1.15, \"units\": \"GRAM\"}}}], \"texture\": {\"type\": \"OIL\", \"details\": \"oil\"}, \"reaction_role\": \"PRODUCT\"}]}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\nYou are a helpful scientific assistant.

Extract information from it to an ORD JSON record.\n\n### Procedure:\nThe product (2.60 parts) of Example 1 above, 2-amino-5,5-dimethyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine hydrochloride, is added to a suitable flask equipped with condenser and magnetic stirring bar, and flushed with argon. There is next added 1.19 parts, 1.5 equivalents, of hydrazine hydrate, and the mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained. The flask is then placed in an oil bath preheated to 115\u00b0 C. Ammonia is evolved almost immediately. The reaction is maintained at 115\u00b0-120\u00b0 C. under a stream of argon for twelve hours. After sitting overnight at room temperature, the flask contains a white, crystalline solid and a small amount of clear, colorless liquid. The liquid is evaporated at room temperature.

The stirred bilayer reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 3 hours. The cooled reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the filter cake washed with fresh benzene. The organic layer was separated and washed with water (3\u00d7), dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum and the residue (46.1 g) purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate (20:1) gave 28.05 g of the product.

The autoclave was cooled to -78\u00b0 C. and 40 g propylene (0.95 mole) and 100 g carbon dioxide (2.3 mole) were introduced. The autoclave was then heated to 100\u00b0 C. for 1.0 hour to reach a total pressure of 196.8 kg/cm2. The autoclave volatiles were then vented into a methyl ethyl ketone solution followed by a 0.10 M megnesium chloride-hydrochloric acid scrubber which trapped the propylene oxide. The excess hydrochloric acid was titrated with 0.10 M sodium hydroxide. The organics remaining in the aqueous solution were measured by standard gas chromatographic techniques. The analysis showed 1.01 mmoles propylene oxide (48% yield), 0.71 mmoles acetone (34% yield) and 0.10 mmoles propylene carbonate (5% yield). 2.1 mmoles of thallous bicarbonate (24% conversion) were detected in the water solution by atomic absorption techniques. The pH of the solution was measured to be 8.1. The yields of oxidized propylene products in this and the following examples are based on the thallic compounds reduced to the thallous state. The conversions of thallic reduction to thallous are based on the starting quantity of thallic compound.\n\n### ORD JSON:\n\n\n{\"inputs\": {\"m1_m2\": {\"components\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"thallic oxide\"}], \"amount\": {\"mass\": {\"value\": 4.0, \"units\": \"GRAM\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"REACTANT\"}, {\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"water\"}], \"amount\": {\"mass\": {\"value\": 30.0, \"units\": \"GRAM\"}}, \"reaction_role\": \"REACTANT\"}]}}, \"conditions\": {\"temperature\": {\"setpoint\": {\"value\": -78.0, \"units\": \"CELSIUS\"}}, \"conditions_are_dynamic\": true}, \"workups\": [{\"type\": \"ADDITION\", \"details\": \"were added to a 300 cc Autoclave Engineers stainless steel Magnedrive Autoclave\"}, {\"type\": \"TEMPERATURE\", \"details\": \"The autoclave was then heated to 100\\u00b0 C. for 1.0 hour\", \"duration\": {\"value\": 1.0, \"units\": \"HOUR\"}}, {\"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"The autoclave was then heated to 100\\u00b0 C. for 1.0 hour\", \"duration\": {\"value\": 1.0, \"units\": \"HOUR\"}}, {\"type\": \"CUSTOM\", \"details\": \"The autoclave volatiles were then vented into a methyl ethyl ketone solution\"}], \"outcomes\": [{\"products\": [{\"identifiers\": [{\"type\": \"NAME\", \"value\": \"propylene\"}], \"measurements\": [{\"type\": \"AMOUNT\", \"details\": \"MOLE\", \"amount\": {\"moles\": {\"value\": 0.95, \"units\": \"MOLE\"}}}, {\"type\": \"AMOUNT\", \"details\": \"MOLE\", \"amount\": {\"moles\": {\"value\": 2.3, \"units\": \"MOLE\"}}}], \"reaction_role\": \"PRODUCT\"}]}]}]}\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a description of an organic reaction.
