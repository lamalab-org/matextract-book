    "\n",
    "That implies that parts of some notebooks (e.g. the finetuning of LLMs or the use of local models pulled from HuggingFace) will not be feasible to run in this environment. (We hope to provide a solution for this in the future.)\n",

    "However, you will be able to run almost all other parts, especially those that call models that are deployed by some model provider such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Groq. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, however, you will need to export your API key as an environment variable. To do so, you only need to update the dictionary below with your API keys and run the subsequent cell. \n",
    "If you want to export additional API keys, you can do so by adding them to the dictionary below. If you do not have an API key for a certain model provider, you can leave the value empty (`\"\"`)."
