One effective validation method involves matching the extracted NMR spectra to the corresponding analyzed molecule. This process compares the number of protons and peaks in the molecule's theoretical NMR spectra with those in the extracted NMR spectra. This approach is similar to that employed by {cite:t}`Patiny_2023`.\n",
