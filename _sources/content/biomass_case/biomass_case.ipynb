As known, porous carbons can be prepared from various precursors, such as organic small molecules, MOFs, mineral coal, synthetic polymers, and biomass.21 Among them, biomass-derived porous carbons as renewable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective functional materials have been extensively developed and applied to many fields such as inks, fuel cells, supercapacitors, catalysts, and adsorbents.22,23 This biomass included catkin, peanut shell, corn stalk, chitosan, and so on.24−26 Recently, considering that they pose threats to human health (respiratory ailments and skin anaphylaxis), porous carbons derived from poplar catkins (PCs) with rich lignin and amino acids, special morphology of microtubes, and high nitrogen content (>4%) have gained considerable attention23,27,28 and have been effectively applied in supercapacitors, adsorbents, electrocatalysts, and oil/water separation.29−32 However, there have been few studies on porous carbons derived from poplar wood sawdust (PWS), a waste product from the wood processing industry, especially on their preparation and applications, such as in gas adsorption and separation fields.

PWS as the raw material was converted into porous carbons by three routes, which produced different physicochemical structures. The digital photographs of all precursors and porous carbons are shown in Figure S1. The white PWS changed into brown BPWS powder and black HPWS sawdust. After activated carbonization, we found that all KOH-activated porous carbons became an irregular powder, while ZnCl2-activated porous carbons changed into a complete monolith with definite strength; especially, BZC-600-2 exhibited stability in 2 mol/L HCl solution and had low density like aerogels. Figure 1 shows the typical morphology and microstructure of these carbons. DKC600-2 was composed of irregular carbon blocks and particles with a rough surface (Figure 1a1,a2); BKC-600-2 had a spongelike network structure with interconnected pores, and its rough surface also accumulated some small carbon particles. Interestingly, a large proportion of the surface of HKC-600-2 possessed vast wormhole-like structures with macropores of 50−100 nm, which was very beneficial for the fast transmission and diffusion of CO2 molecules.\n",

The traditional commercial CO2 capture using aqueous ethanolic amines by chemical absorption is highly effective and mature, but it has intrinsic drawbacks such as high regeneration costs and severe corrosion.5 Notably, the solid adsorbent bed composed of porous materials in a pressure, temperature, and vacuum swing adsorption (P/T/VSA) gas separation system could selectively adsorb CO2 from a humid flue gas; in this way, it has been attracting increasing attention owing to its low cost and environmentally friendly merits in recent years.6−8 Carbon-based materials, such as graphene,9 nanotubes, and nanoporous carbons,10−13 are one of the most advanced adsorbents including porous organic polymers (POPs),14−18 zeolites,19 and metal−organic frameworks (MOFs)20 because of their high specific areas, strong hydrophobicity, low density, and excellent stability. As known, porous carbons can be prepared from various precursors, such as organic small molecules, MOFs, mineral coal, synthetic polymers, and biomass.21 Among them, biomass-derived porous carbons as renewable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective functional materials have been extensively developed and applied to many fields such as inks, fuel cells, supercapacitors, catalysts, and adsorbents.22,23 This biomass included catkin, peanut shell, corn stalk, chitosan, and so on.24−26 Recently, considering that they pose threats to human health (respiratory ailments and skin anaphylaxis), porous carbons derived from poplar catkins (PCs) with rich lignin and amino acids, special morphology of microtubes, and high nitrogen content (>4%) have gained considerable attention23,27,28 and have been effectively applied in supercapacitors, adsorbents, electrocatalysts, and oil/water separation.29−32 However, there have been few studies on porous carbons derived from poplar wood sawdust (PWS), a waste product from the wood processing industry, especially on their preparation and applications, such as in gas adsorption and separation fields. Therefore, we selected PWS as the raw material to achieve porous carbons with excellent microporosity and various morphologies via different preparation routes for outstanding CO2 capture.\n",

PWS as the raw material was converted into porous carbons by three routes, which produced different physicochemical structures. The digital photographs of all precursors and porous carbons are shown in Figure S1. The white PWS changed into brown BPWS powder and black HPWS sawdust. After activated carbonization, we found that all KOH-activated porous carbons became an irregular powder, while ZnCl2-activated porous carbons changed into a complete monolith with definite strength; especially, BZC-600-2 exhibited stability in 2 mol/L HCl solution and had low density like aerogels. Figure 1 shows the typical morphology and microstructure of these carbons. DKC600-2 was composed of irregular carbon blocks and particles with a rough surface (Figure 1a1,a2); BKC-600-2 had a spongelike network structure with interconnected pores, and its rough surface also accumulated some small carbon particles. Interestingly, a large proportion of the surface of HKC-600-2 possessed vast wormhole-like structures with macropores of 50−100 nm, which was very beneficial for the fast transmission and diffusion of CO2 molecules.\n",

I can extract the following variables:\\n\\n{'sample_name': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'value': None}, \\n'pretreatment_process_method': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'value': None}, \\n'pretreatment_activation_chemical_agent': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'value': None}, \\n'activation_temperature': {'type': <class 'int'>, 'value': None}, \\n'activation_temperature_units': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'value': 'K'}, \\n'co2_uptake_amount': {'type': <class 'float'>, 'value': None}, \\n'co2_uptake_units': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'value': None}}\\n\\nNote that I couldn't find values for 'sample_name', 'pretreatment_process_method', 'pretreatment_activation_chemical_agent', 'activation_temperature', and 'co2_uptake_amount' in the provided text. Also, I extracted the unit of 'activation_temperature' as 'K' (Kelvin) which is a unit of temperature.\\n\\nPlease let me know if I should proceed with the next chunk of text or if you need any further clarification.\n",
